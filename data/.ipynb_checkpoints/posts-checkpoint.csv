0,latterdaysaints,"In the D&amp;C, the Lord describes his omniscience as:

&gt;The same which [knoweth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note2a) all things, for [all](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note2b) things are [present](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note2c) before mine eyes;

In this context, in Nephi's vision, Nephi has an exchange with the ""Spirit of the Lord"", very similar to the Brother of Jared's vision of the premortal Christ:

&gt;For I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the [form](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note11b) of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.

Leaving aside the very interesting point that the BOM is highly consistent with later revealed doctrines of a corporeal God, it seems that the text supports the conclusion that Nephi was seeing the future *as it happened* in the same way that all things are present to the Lord*.*  Somehow, Nephi was taken outside of time to see the actual future.  

&gt;**12** And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.  
&gt;  
&gt;**13** And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of [Nazareth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note13a) I beheld a [virgin](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note13b), and she was exceedingly fair and white.  
&gt;  
&gt;**14** And it came to pass that I saw the [heavens](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note14a) open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?

In other words, Christ departs from Nephi at the precise moment Christ enters the history Nephi is witnessing.  An angel continues the narration of the vision in his place.  It seems that Nephi is not viewing a *vision* of the future, but is viewing the *actual future* as it happens. 

It may be a coincidence, but as it stands it is a fascinating integration with the doctrine revealed in D&amp;C 38.   In the Book of Mormon the atonement of Christ also carries this same ""outside of time"" effect, in that it was efficacious *backward* through time to peoples who lived before the atonement had actually happened. 

The en vogue alternative explanation of the BOM is that JS dashed it off in a rush, drawing from various resources in his environment.  But it is little intricacies like this--a coherent concept of atemporality embedded within the change of a narrators in a vision-- that make it difficult to believe that theory.

3,latterdaysaints,"So yesterday the Sunday School president held the teaching in the savior's way class. I was walking the halls with our baby during sacrament and I saw him in then hallway. He told me where it was going to be held and that he was looking forward to it. 

My wife and I came to the class about 15 minutes late as we were watching our daughter give a talk in primary. When we entered the room he had a video clip playing. The guy in then clip was some sort of professor and was talking to a group of people about how man was nothing more than a force to be acted upon and that we were nothing more than animals. At one point  the guy even said that we would be cannabalistic lol. I'm looking around at everyone to see if they're as creeped out by the video and the spirit in the room as I am and most of us all look confused and somber. At this point the 1st counselor who was in attendance told him that he needed to turn it off right now and that it was inviting a bad spirit into the room. The SSP refused and then the 1st counselor stood up and told him to turn it off or else he would. 

It was super awkward and I was waiting for the SSP to freak out or something but he turned it off reluctantly.  He then askednus if we agreed with the teacher on the video and what our thoughts were. We all just sat there in shock of what we saw on the TV and what we witnessed from the interaction moments before.
The lesson moved on after that but the 1st counselor sort of took it over lol.

7,latterdaysaints,"I have a LOT of issues with church. I am mostly talking about the church, policies, culture etc. 
I actually quite enjoy the gospel, the pure gospel. You know the one about Christ, and the Atonement. Faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the holy ghost, and enduring to the end. That... I believe, and I love the simplicity of it. The church can get so muddied with everything else, WoW, chastity, tithing, etc. That I rarely hear about it. 

Anyway the point of this is, I've kept most of my issues and doubts to myself. I don't talk with anyone, as most people in my social circles are either anti mormons/anti religion, or devout zealots that don't want to think about these questions I have.

I recently opened up to two of my good friends, one was on New year's I explained how I was inactive and had issues etc. Another was just this last weekend my best friend was visiting and I opened up to him about it as well.

Both experiences were the same. The immedialy started preaching, telling me what I should do, etc. Stuff I already knew. Neither of them let me talk though my issues. And maybe it's my own stubbornness... I just felt like they weren't listening and just put in a cassette tape and started spewing the religious dogma that I've heard over and over again. 

I can see why people turn to forums like r/ exmormon now... the problem is, I want to believe so I don't want to be drug down that path. I feel like I have no one to talk to, because no one will listen. Maybe this is just sometbing I have wrestle with internally...",I don't know who to talk to?

12,latterdaysaints,[removed],Inappropriate Disciplinary Action?
13,latterdaysaints,"Sorry for the long post, but I feel like getting this off my chest and I thought ‚Äú What better way than to post my testimony, due to the events from today‚Äù. If this post takes away from any rules the please delete it.

I grew up in Southern California, while I grew up I had this really close friend (who was also a member). We did The typical Teenager thing, Video Games, Movies, Talk about Girls etc... but what we loved doing the most was play basketball. Of course growing up in SoCal we watched one player like glue, Kobe Bryant, I have grown up watching him as long as I can remember. 

Unfortunately my friend who was battling some inner demons, demons I can‚Äôt even imagine or fathom, and he lost that battle to those demons and passed away. I was devastated I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it, as a young teenager I did not have a strong relationship in my Heavenly Father so I felt lost and confused, I thought my friend was gone forever. After a lot of thought and prayer from a close leader ( Who I am forever Grateful for) he sat me down and reminded me about the Plan of Salvation and challenged me to ask for myself if this Plan was true. That‚Äôs what I did, for the first time in months I felt the spirit and without a doubt that those who passed on are not dammed but in a better place, what  my leader and I talked about that afternoon, I knew it was true with every ounce in me.

This obviously led me down a path to better myself, to repent of my sins, and try to live as Christlike as possible. It‚Äôs tough to live a Christlike life in SoCal, when so many temptations are around you. With me deciding to go on a mission I tried my best to stay on that path, I looked up to Kobe Bryant to help me, I especially loved his take on Mamba mentality. Too quote the late Kobe Bryant, """"If you see me in a fight with a bear, prey for the bear"". Ive always loved that quote. Thats ""mamba mentality"" we don't quit, we don't cower, we don't run. We endure and conquer. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever...Mamba Out.""

This Quote has carried me to this day, on my mission I struggled but I remembered this quote, after my mission I fell away for a little bit, but this quote helped me understand who I really was. And through school this quote helps me power through the grind and helps me remember that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and I don‚Äôt belong in any of the groups that want me to join. Even though being a member is not easy (To some of us) we need to grind trough the pain and remember who we are, sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father.

Today before sacrament meeting, I found out that Kobe and his daughter passed away in a helicopter. I still live in SoCal attending a YSA and it was somber, there was a sadness from those who have grown up watching him play, and from those who hated him, but I am grateful to have a knowledge that those who have passed on have started a beautiful journey to return to our Heavenly Father.

My prayers go out to the Bryant family and those who lost loved ones today in the cash, and elsewhere in the world.

Article of Faith #8 says
&gt;We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly
But we also know that over many hundreds of years lots of important Bible material has been lost, as described in 1 Nephi 13:28:
&gt;Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and precious things taken away from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.

I've been reading Jesus the Christ and in Chapter 9 Elder Talmage gives such a strong example of this.  In it he quotes Matthew 2:23, talking about Jesus: 
&gt;And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

Elder Talmage then writes:
&gt;He is also referred to as a Nazarene, or a native of Nazareth, and this fact is cited by Matthew as a fulfillment of earlier prediction, though our current compilation of scriptures constituting the Old Testament contains no record of such prophecy. It is practically certain that this prediction was contained in some one of the many scriptures extant in earlier days but since lost.

I've never realized this until now but it provides such strong evidence for what we know about the Bible due to the Restored Gospel and modern revelation.

One on my callings is Ward Mission Leader at a YSA ward and absolutely love it. Held the calling for a year and a half by now. The missionary committee and full-time missionaries meet every week for correlation. During correlation, side conversations begin to develop then snowball into 3-4 different conversations that disrupt anyone attempting to report. Even after implementing a recommendation from an Elder by limiting the time for reports to 10 minutes, yet the disruptions  continue. We've implemented this since it was brought to my attention that the members and missionaries would get restless. 

I have noticed that a branch missionary begin to make side conversations and I have asked them to halt side conversations, but they become defensive and say that I'm targeting them.  Was I wrong on bringing this to attention? In all honesty, I feel outnumbered since I'm not as available for lessons nor connecting with the branch and full-time missionaries.

20,latterdaysaints,"TL;DR I accidentally bought Coffee ice cream for a Memorial dinner of a member in our ward. SP served it. HP took leftovers home.

This weekend we had a memorial dinner for a dear ward member that recently passed. He had no family, and wanted to donate his body to medical research, so we didn‚Äôt have a formal service for him. He loved our ward‚Äôs potluck dinners... and he loved ice cream. 

I found a great deal on 1.75qt Turkey Hill Ice Cream; 2 for $5. I bought 10 and stuck‚Äôem in the freezer at church. One of them called Double Dunker. Unbeknownst to me... it had coffee in it.

The dinner was great! We then shared a few memories of our buddy, which were many. Next up? Dessert!

I took out all the ice cream and got some helpers to scoop so we could serve efficiently. About 7 of the first 10 people in line asked for a scoop of the Double Dunker. The man scooping the Double Dunker? Our SP.

It took about 10 minutes until someone, a HP, came back and grabbed the Double Dunker to read the ingredients. To everyone‚Äôs shock, yep! Coffee. 

Needless to say I was embarrassed. We laughed it off and the SP said I‚Äôm speaking at the next Stake Conference to share this story. Ha. Ha. Ha.

We tossed the rest in the garbage and continued serving seconds to the kids. We then announced there were ice cream leftovers anyone was welcome to take. Just then, another brother that‚Äôs also a HP came back to check out the Double Dunker.

‚ÄúOh, we threw the rest away. It had coffee in it.‚Äù

I'm having finding such images.  I can find images of the [original manuscript taken to the printer](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/printers-manuscript-of-the-book-of-mormon-circa-august-1829-circa-january-1830/1), which is hand written mostly by Oliver Cowdrey.  But as I understand it, these were a hand-written copy of the original scribed pages.  Images of those original pages is what I'm interested in.

From [Original Text of The Book of Mormon by Royal Skouson](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/the-original-text-of-the-book-of-mormon-and-its-publication-by-yale-university-press/): ""The largest part of the work in recovering the original text involves two manuscripts. The most important of these is the original manuscript (O), the one that Joseph Smith dictated to his scribes. The other manuscript is called the printer‚Äôs manuscript (P), and it is a copy of the original manuscript. This second manuscript is the one that was prepared to take to the Palymra, New York, printer E. B. Grandin in 1829-30 to set the type. Approximately 28 percent of the original manuscript is extant... In 1841 Joseph Smith placed the original manuscript in the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House, a hotel being built in Nauvoo. The manuscript lay there in the cornerstone for the next 41 years until in 1882 Lewis Bidamon, the second husband of Emma Smith‚Äôs, after her death, retrieved the manuscript. Most of it was severely damaged by water that had seeped in; much of it had been eaten away by mold. Bidamon gave most of the larger manuscript portions to LDS people. As a result, **25 of that 28 percent has ended up in the archives of the LDS Church.** The LDS portions cover from 1 Nephi 2 to 2 Nephi 1, from Alma 22 to Alma 60, and from Alma 62 to Helaman 3, and include other minor fragments. \[Page 59\]There is also half a leaf at the University of Utah (from 1 Nephi 14).

27,latterdaysaints,"So here is my situation.
About 20 years ago I studied apologetics stuff and then nonfavorable items to try and fight it and had my testimony shattered and lost all faith and belief in the church. I even considered in my deep anger phase of removing my records from the church. I absolutely hated this vile organization.
Then in 2007 my house flooded and my family spent a week living in the church and I had members helping me rebuild. The organization is evil but the members locally are good people. So my views were more nuanced. Still no testimony though.
I would read heavily antimormon stuff and even wrote on and posted to all the boards. I wrote constantly how bad the church was and how much I didn't like it.
I still sporadically attended to save my marriage and my wife was patient. I would think..""what do I have to show you to make you understand the church is false. How brainwashed are you? ""
CES Letter, Letter to My Wife, etc., I've read them. I've also read heavily from FAIR, Maxwell Institute etc...and I've slowly began to realize something very interesting.

You can prove the church 100% false
You can prove the church 100% true

This in itself is rare with most things. 

President Nielson has said even with more discoveries it is still going to be impossible to intellectually prove the church true or false. If that were possible our agency would be destroyed.

We have to make a choice.

This in itself is amazing to me, and our testimony or lack of one is completely in our hands and what we focus on. If we focus and look for the good, we will find the good, also the same with the bad.

Some other things are happening that make imperative though I pick a side.
I made a promise to my wife I wouldn't bad mouth the church with my kids. So I drove them to seminary all these years and have asked them what they are learning and though I'd sometimes roll my eyes... I'd listen.

Well now they are all graduated and out of school and 2 of them just got mission calls. I have to figure this out. Am I going to be the one helping them prepare or what for temple and becoming Elders.

So I wrote out some questions regarding the good and bad for me.

What harm do I get from living the gospel?
What benefit?
What harm from not living or believing?
What benefit?

Then I answered all of these personally for myself.

I looked at my strengths and weaknesses and imagined where my life would be with or without.

Without any belief in God... I'd be dead. I also thought of spiritual events I've experienced that I've never been able to use secular explanations to resolve them

So I decided and told my wife I either need to"" poop or get off the pot""

47,latterdaysaints,"Hi! So I started talking to my long time friend who happens to be lds about religion a week ago and I have to say I was interested in what she was saying. It sounds like something I would be interested in learning more about. However, there are a few things I'm hesitant about. Not sure if this is the right place to post this, so I apologize if it's not. 

1) I'm currently a early 20s female who is in medical school. I have always wanted to be a physician, and this is a dream of mine. I understand that the church teaches that motherhood is the highest calling. I want to be a wife and mother very very much. But I am not willing to give up medicine, and I am unsure how that would work. I understand that a lot of men want a wife that would stay at home with the children. Which brings me to my second point...

2) I am of Iranian decent. My family has been in the US for 50+ years, and they are agnostic. Already my dating pool is much lower than someone who is white, simply because there are much fewer iranians. My question is this: If I were to convert into the church, would't it be difficult to find a husband? Because I think it would be hard to date a non lds iranian and expect them to convert, and I'm not sure how many iranians are in the church in the US. I also don't even know how many non-iranian lds men would want to marry outside of their race. I am not willing to give up marriage, and this is a stumbling block I keep encountering. 

I thought about talking to someone at my local church, but I feel like they may just brush over these issues and tell me to pray about it. I guess I keep thinking, let's say I convert and pray about this, and end up not able to find a husband and not have children. I would be extraordinarily resentful if this were to occur. I understand I may be ""jumping the gun"" a bit, but I think these are very relevant issues that I need to think about. I wonder if anyone had any advice? Thank you.",Interested but also hesitant

I will just go ahead and put a fair warning here in case anyone needs it: mentions of emotional abuse, molestation, and neglect 

I feel I am in such a dark place right now and I don‚Äôt know how to get out. I have always been very faithful and at times joyful despite what has happened to me, what I still go through. I owe these small joys to the gospel, I think. But lately, I feel as if I am being consumed by a darkness that is caused by trauma. I feel like I have a huge hole in my heart that‚Äôs only getting bigger and bigger. 

I currently live with, and have for 15 years dealt with, an emotionally abusive ‚Äústep-father‚Äù. I cannot begin to stress how my self worth, my belief in love and marriage, and my trust in others (particularly men) has dwindled.  I have a mother who I thought protected me from him for many years, but have recently come to realize the only one she‚Äôs protecting is herself, based on things she has said to me and shown me. I guess I should‚Äôve known a long time ago just based on the fact that she refuses to leave him even though she has witnessed his awful nature first-hand. I have expressed to her how this man has made me and my siblings feel, and all I ever get back from her is yelling and being told that I am ‚Äústressing her out‚Äù. I have even informed her that the situation has made me suicidal, and all I get from her in return is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to deal with this‚Äù. My life itself is not even of big concern to her. I think if I killed myself, it wouldn‚Äôt matter much to her. As long as she has her ‚Äúeternal companion‚Äù, she‚Äôs happy. Who needs kids?

I have been told time and time again that this man is her ‚Äúeternal companion‚Äù, and she is going to put him first no matter what. Bare in mind that this is a man who has threatened to beat my sister multiple times while telling her that the cops wouldnt help her, has locked me and my siblings and mother out of the house for days, taken all our money leaving a mom and 3 kids only $5 in their bank account, and many other selfish and hurtful things I won‚Äôt mention.

I feel my life is not worth anything often. If my siblings were not in my life, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here right now. But with the way things are going right now, the stress and sadness I feel daily, I‚Äòm scared that one day I might not be able to take it anymore. I have seen a therapist recently, and she has helped me tremendously. But it is still hard to remember her advice and to cope day in and day out. I realize now that my mother and step father are both mentally unwell, but since me and my siblings still live with them I am forced to deal with this trauma on a daily basis, and it has begun to affect my testimony in the gospel. 

My bishop knows about the abuse, my extended family knows, so many people have known for years. Nothing is ever done. All everyone worries about is my mothers mental state, and her ‚Äúeternal companion‚Äù. Nobody cares about our mental state. Nobody will help us, or even attempt to. Me and my siblings are not worth the trouble, it seems. 

I have had my grandma tell me we are supposed to forgive ‚Äúseventy times seven‚Äù, but I just cannot bring myself to do that at this time in my life, and I find myself getting so upset whenever the topic of forgiveness is brought up to me in and outside of church. I feel completely abandoned by everyone- God, Christ, family, and everyone else who knows us and is aware of our situation. I feel that because no physical abuse has been done, everyone believes that this situation is not dire. There have been close calls (escalations to a physical altercation), so I fear one day it may actually happen, but maybe nothing will even be done then too. I have even been told by my mother and others that it is not ‚Äúreally‚Äù abuse, since no one is being beaten or molested (this man has a history of sexual abuse with minors and has not been punished for it in any way, shape, or form, so I consider this a huge blessing), but often I find myself wishing the man would take a swing at me or do something drastic so someone might take it seriously and we could get him out of our lives. 

I have been very bothered by my entire extended family telling me and my siblings that he‚Äôs her eternal companion and we‚Äôre ‚Äújust her kids‚Äù and she needs to put him first. Always. It is such a punch to the gut to know someone who dislikes you, someone who puts you down in any way they can, is more important than you to your loved ones. More important to your own mother than you. 

I talked to my bishop about this particular idea  about her putting him first, because it was really bothering me and I had to know if it was true. He told me that it is indeed true, that he is a more important relationship to my mother than us, and I broke down crying. In that moment, I felt myself take a huge hit spiritually. He told me he was sorry, and that he knows it‚Äôs hard to hear, but what will him being sorry do for me or my family? My little brother is growing up without a mom or dad (because my ‚Äústep-father‚Äù keeps her with him 24/7, they work together and as soon as they come home, they usually go to their room and lock the door. I can go days without seeing them, which is ok for me, but my little brother NEEDS a parental figure) and an abusive man who puts him down whenever he can. He is an adolescent being traumatized, but that doesn‚Äôt matter because after all, we arent her eternal companions. We‚Äôre just her kids. I guess we were just put on this earth to replenish it, and nothing else. I always thought that families were forever, but it seems I was wrong and that only spouses are forever. 

The only thing I can do right now to keep myself from falling further away from the gospel and my Heavenly Father is prayer. I truly cannot imagine the gospel not being in my life, but I cannot continue to be with a group of people I feel do not value me or my siblings at all, excuse abuse so easily, and look at children as just a means to keep replenishing the earth. I just am at a loss at what to do. I want the church in my life, but I can‚Äôt even make it to second hour anymore because every Sunday being in such close proximity to that man and my mother is torture- In second hour, either he verbally gets mad at my mom for talking to me and my sister, or I hear so many things from other women that I know my mother will use as ammo against me and my siblings if we dare speak up about this situation to her.

I have to put up such a strong and spiritual front to encourage my siblings, because they‚Äôre losing their faith as well, and I don‚Äôt want them to. I am trying to be the strong pillar of support and faith my patriarchal blessing says I can be, but I can‚Äôt deny that I‚Äôm feeling the same way as them and it‚Äôs tearing me up inside. I just need to hear something from someone.. I don‚Äôt know what it is. Maybe that I am worth something. That someone feels pain for the situation I‚Äôm in. That having a loving family is possible. Maybe I need to hear that I‚Äôm not crazy, and that the lack of help and concern and the words from my extended family members are both horrendous and untrue. I want to believe that my Heavenly Father and Savior care about and love me, but how can they when the gospel of Jesus Christ supposedly teaches that a man, who has ruined me and my siblings lives and done so many wretched things, is more important than I? 

I pray and pray for comfort, love and warmth, but I do not feel it. I know circumstances cannot always change, but I at least don‚Äôt want to give others the power of affecting my testimony and happiness. I at least want be able to go through challenges with a smile, and know that I have my savior with me.

I want to make it clear that despite my moms huge short-comings and flaws, I love her with all my heart, even if it‚Äôs not reciprocated to the same length back. While she has become neglectful emotionally, she still houses and feeds us so I cannot complain too much. She even is paying for my college education, because she wants to help me succeed. I do not think she‚Äôs a horrible person, and I know I will always love her. I yearn to keep my relationship with her, but I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible as long as she stays with that man. In that same aspect, I want to keep the church, Christ and God in my life, but am struggling so hard with what it seems the gospels principals and values on families are.","I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm losing my testimony, and I‚Äôm terrified."

When we speak of the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù, we usually mean the Church of Jesus Christ headquartered in Salt Lake City, perhaps expressed best in scripture as:

&gt; **30** And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have [power](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note30a) to lay the foundation of this [church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note30b), and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of [darkness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note30c), the only true and living [church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note30d) upon the face of the whole earth, 

But I wonder if that passage is over-interpreted.  For example, some passages make it appear that the Lord has a broader understanding of who is a member of his church.  To be clear, I don't make this point to undermine the very important mission of the Church of Jesus Christ in the last days.  Rather, it seems to me that the Lord has a broader ""tent"" in mind for his ""church"" in the last days than just the formal church. 

Here is the Lord speaking, one year before JS organized the Church of Christ, in which the Lord clearly contemplates a ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù concept of ‚Äúchurch‚Äù rather than an ‚Äúorganizational‚Äù concept of church:

&gt;**67** Behold, this is my doctrine‚Äîwhosoever repenteth and [cometh](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note67a) unto me, the same is my [church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note67b).  
&gt;  
&gt;**68** Whosoever [declareth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note68a) more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is [against](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note68b) me; therefore he is not of my church.  
&gt;  
&gt;**69** And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and [endureth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note69a) of my church to the end, him will I establish upon my [rock](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note69b), and the [gates](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note69c) of hell shall not prevail against them.

In a similar vein, here is an angel of the Lord editorializing to Nephi about his vision of the great and abominable church.  

&gt;**10** And he said unto me: Behold there are save [two](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10a) churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the [other](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10b) is the church of the [devil](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10c); wherefore, [whoso](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10d) belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the [whore](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10e) of all the earth.

One way to read this is that everyone who is not a member of the organized Church is in the G&amp;A church. But that interpretation seems inconsistent in context; it would require reading the G&amp;A metaphorically and the church of the Lamb literally (as the organized SLC church). While that reading is textually possible, in the context of a vision that is largely metaphorical, it strikes me as highly plausible--likely--that the church of the Lamb is also metaphorical.  The G&amp;A church is defined by their desires--harlots, fine clothing, etc.  In a day of increasing prosperity and porn, it's not hard to see how these desires are on the rise in our culture (at least in the developed world).  

If this interpretation is correct there are many outside of the formal Church who are members of the church of the Lamb and many inside the formal church who are members of the G&amp;A church.

This conclusion is consistent with Nephi's prophecy:

&gt; 1**0** For the [time](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10a) speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great [division](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10b) among the people, and the wicked will he [destroy](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10c); and he will [spare](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10d) his people, yea, even if it so be that he must [destroy](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/#note10e) the wicked by fire.

People ask but after getting an answer leave it at that. And drinking while working is absolutely forbidden (thank goodness).

However, alcohol is taken as such a normal part of our work social culture. When my team goes out, alcohol is always involved and is a large part of the social event. Even at my work's last Christmas party there was only finger food and then freeflowing alcohol. I managed 3 hours before I clocked out from that party. Any team event is usually a minor activity plus alcohol for the rest. For those of us who do not drink, not exactly great.

I mentioned this to my boss recently that I felt it was limiting for our social activities to pretty much only focus on alcohol because it leaves out enjoyable activities that everyone can enjoy and is not inclusive of everyone on the team 

Lo and behold, another boss has now announced activities should not be alcohol focused only but inclusive activities which people can then drink afterwards if they choose. And my boss discussed this with my unit in more detail so I am clearly not the only person to have raised this.

I appreciate the change in attitude but do not want to make people feel like I judge them for drinking, while I still think I should be able to ask for not all activities to be drinking only.

72,latterdaysaints,"Disclaimer: This post contains my own personal musings and should not be misinterpreted as official doctrine of the Church.

A reddit user replied to one of my comments a while ago asking about how I can believe in the three kingdoms of heaven doctrine when the Bible doesn't support it. This got me to go do some research.

Starting off I was already aware of the reference to the ""third heaven"" in the New Testament NOT being a reference to the Celestial kingdom as understood in the L-dS Church.

And I also was aware that there is debate as to whether or not Joseph Smith cribbed the three kingdoms of heaven from Swedenborg. 

That ended up taking me to 1 Corinthians 14:35-49. To summarize, these verses are also NOT saying there are three heavens. What it is saying is that there are two types of bodies. First Terrestrial bodies of flesh that we currently have now, and after the ressurection there will be Celestial spiritual bodies.

After reading D&amp;C sections 76 and 88 I don't think these sections are misinterpreting the NT verses. Rather I think they are expounding in them. So the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial are sub categories of the Celestial bodies mentioned in the NT. Meaning the Terrestrial bodies of the D&amp;C are not a misinterpretation of the Terrestrial bodies of the NT. Instead they are something else that just uses the same word to describe them.

Now some people read section 131 and think this means there are three levels within the Celestial kingdom. But section 131 is actually a conglomeration of snippets. The first part coming from William Clayton's journal. Furthermore, the part in brackets is not in the original.

So when Joseph Smith purportedly says: 
1 In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;
2 And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood;

He is referring to the NT Celestial glory, not the D&amp;C Celestial glory.

TLDR; To put it more simply there are two glories:
The Terrestrial - the bodies we have now.
The Celestial - the future resurrected bodies.

Within the celestial there are three subtypes:
The Celestial
The Terrestrial
And the Telestial

This is what is refered to in section 131, not an additional subsubtype of the Celestial.",Does the Celestial kingdom have three subdegrees?

74,latterdaysaints," Now what did the three witnesses see? D&amp;C Section 17:1 Behold, I say  unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which if you do with full  purpose of heart  you shall have a view of  the plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim  and Thummim, which were given to the brother of Jared upon the mount,  when he talked with the Lord face to face, and the miraculous directors  which were given to Lehi while in the wilderness, on the borders of the  Red Sea.  
 

2 And it is by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them, even by that faith which was had by the prophets of old.  
 

3 And after that you have obtained faith, and have seen them with your eyes, you shall testify of them, by the power of God;  
 

4 And this you shall do that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may not be  destroyed, that I may bring about my righteous purposes unto the  children of men in this work.  
 

While Joseph had at least one seer stone, quite biblical by the way, it was the above items that the three witnesses were to bear witness of, and did. Quite impressive.  No important real new information has come out in the last almost two  hundred years, but some modern day historians are now changing the focus  to actually bend more towards anti Church forces, and the continued  drum beat of ""folk magic"" to explain away what was actually seen and  heard by the three and the eight witnesses, to the point that those real tangible items they were commanded to bear witness of were actually not needed, or used, or even never really existed.   
 

Here is an interesting Book of Mormon scripture on this subject.   Alma 37:23 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, ***a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light***,  that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover  unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their  works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.""        

 Here is one more piece of information.

The Hebrew word Zohar, means ‚Äúlight‚Äù or  ‚Äúbrilliance‚Äù and that light was connected with magical stones. The  Brother of Jared logically thought that if it worked for Noah, it could  work for his eight dark ships. Hence, sixteen stones presented to the  Savior to be set aglow by His touch.""[https://thirdhour.org/blog/faith/jew-reads-book-mormon/](https://thirdhour.org/blog/faith/jew-reads-book-mormon/)",Progressive LDS historians and others are trying to change the historical narrative regarding the translation process part two

What about the kids? Let‚Äôs say both parents are active in the children‚Äôs lives and have shared custody. Does one of them really have to sign away their rights, allow a step parent to adopt their children, and only then can the children be sealed to that step parent and biological parent?

94,latterdaysaints,"So while stuck rocking a fussy baby to sleep, I found the ""Escaping Polygamy"" show on YouTube. No big deal, I've seen some shows about polygamy families before. Usually, there isn't a whole ton of similarities to what we practice, other than maybe baptism and utilizing the BOM. It doesn't usually phase me, and it's interesting, in a morbid sort of way. The shows usually either feature people happy with their choices, or escaping. 

Well, there were some episodes about some women escaping from the FLDS, particularly Warren Jeff's daughter. She mentioned how they couldn't cut their hair, or they couldn't go in the temple... They have a temple? Well that lead me down a whole different rabbit hole. Flds temple ceremonies... Claims about early temple ceremonies in Joseph Smiths time...

And, in addition to that, then Kingston clan. Hearing some of the men speak, some of the eerie similarities, some things just close enough to home that it gave me the chills. And not in a good way. Or seeing where they broke off from the mainstream church, and just kind of hurting that something that broke off from my religion formed into something so horrible and abusive. 

 *Trigger warning* gosh, apparently there's even claims of tapes of Warran Jeff's abusing women and saying phrases from our ordinances... I just came away from it all feeling really gross. 

Polygamy has never been an easy topic for me, as a sister, and abuse victim myself. And as women have been the victims of abuse for much of history, and the pursuit of sex has been at the core of so many institutions throughout history.... I just started to fear. What if it was just about sex? It's hard to reconcile the faith I feel in the modern church with the fear that it could be built on something so horrible. I know no member will ever be perfect, but it would be impossible to know just how deep that stain could run... 

I've read alot of the Fairmormon stuff on polygamy. I know that the actual firsthand sources we have on the specifics are very few and far in between, and that it's so easy for someone on the internet to claim this or that happened... 

Not really sure where the point is. I guess, anyone have any similar issues? Any good sources to help me sort it out? I consider myself a very faithful person with a strong testimony, I've been through quite alot in my life, and it takes more than just stuff on the internet to shake me.

I have been studying on my own and with our wards Missionaries for close to a year. Wanting  to get baptized but unable to as I had lived with a male companion and couldn't become baptized. So I started staying elsewhere until we are married. I've repented for my sins accepted my path and know this is what is right for my family and I. I finally had my Interview with the mission president and was given the go ahead for baptism.. 

So with the embarrassment out of the way the second part is I recently got hired for a job that is great. It's something that fits in with my current nursing career and has been a long time dream of mine to receive,  but with that said I got a call from my new employer and was informed that I would have to work Sunday's. 

I asked if there was any way to avoid this but he said that it's the day they're closed and would be able to get the most jobs done.  Knowing that requesting Sunday off meant that I would be passed by for the job or I'd miss Church by accepting the job has been an excruciating dilemma. 

I have worked so hard for this blessing (Baptism) and want it and all that comes with it. I am ready for my calling as well, I know it will be great!  But I don't know what to do if I take the job I won't be able to be consistent with my work in the church. If decline the job I will continue working in a job that's not my favorite but be able to continue my church life and commitment and become an example to my children and family.

114,latterdaysaints,"I live in the Philippines so I apologize if my English sounds weird. 

My great grandfather and grandpa's Bro to my mother's side were Seventh Day Adventist ministers. My Grandpa broke up from the faith when he married and became a pastor for the Church of Christ, a protestant church based off in Texas. He was paid well for his ministry and eventually became the church's ""evangelist"" (the equivalent of LDS mission president, at least in scope of work).

After high school I enrolled at the Bible School where Grandpa was its director. I was immediately assigned to a branch of around 70 members after graduating from Bible School and got paid for my work as a pastor. 

Not far from the church assigned to me was my aunt's house. She was a less-active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When she was baptized into The Church in the 80's my grandparents and her siblings including my mom were furious at her. She was disowned by them. And although she stopped going to LDS church at the time she still has testimony of The Church and its doctrine. I remember I often dropped by her place to discuss the difference of our beliefs and why she decided to leave her family's religion. Sometimes I go to her house just to debate with her. Little did I know, it planted a seed of faith in my own heart. 

Eventually, I found myself wondering if I belonged to the true church. Corruption in our church was a big issue and it led me to seeking ""true doctrine"". 

I remember praying hard asking the Lord to lead me to the true church and everytime I was done praying I could always recall my discussions with my aunt and what she told me about The Book of Mormon, the prophet Joseph Smith, the pioneers' trek to the Rocky mountains, etc. I just interpreted it as the Lord's answer to my prayers.

Not long after, I began my search for missionaries. It took me weeks until I finally found sister missionaries in a busy intersection walking incredibly fast. I had to run after them and called out to them ""Sisters, sisters"". They stopped and with a smile asked me ""Oh hey Brother, are you a member? Is there anything we can help you with?"". Still catching my breath I replied ""No, I'm not a member of your church, but I'm interested in having a Bible study with you."" It's still clear in my memory the glow in their eyes. We set an appointment and 3 days after it was Sunday. I went to my church as usual only this time I told the members that we had to cut short our Sunday services because I had a ""very important matter to attend to"". It was my last time in that church. 

Right after ending our church service I hurried to meet with the missionaries. I had to travel 5 hours to the city. Our meeting place was at an LDS chapel in the same city. They invited a young man to join in the discussion. I remember listening to them about The First Vision and how warm it felt like. It was as if I was in a Spiritual prison all my life and that I was being told at that moment that I'm gonna be freed soon. And although I was trained to debate pastors of other religion (and oh boy I was good at it) I found myself very silent and just absorbing and believing without any trace of doubt what the missionaries were saying. 

At the end of the discussion, the missionaries asked if I have any questions. I was overjoyed. I wanted to hide what I felt for fear of embarrassment but it was too much. I couldn't speak. I just cried. When I regained my ability to speak, I told them ""I know everything you told me is the truth. When can I be baptized?""

With permission from the mission president I was allowed to get baptized into The Church 2 weeks later because I was meeting with the missionaries everyday for the missionary lessons after we first met. And I was working with them in their lessons with other investigators. Imagine an investigator testifying of the Gospel to another investigator and inviting them to get baptized with me. 

A couple months later my parents and 5 siblings got baptized as well. My grandparents and other extended family members were divastated and disowned us. Of course, I lost my income too. But it didn't matter. We finally found the truth and it's the only thing that matters to us. 

2 years after my baptism, I was 22 and went to serve a full-time mission. QI returned home with honor. Married in the temple 2 months after my release. Wife and I have 2 girls together now (5 and 9). And today we are celebrating our 10th wedding anniversarry. 

I currently serve in the Elders Quorum. Working 2 day jobs and studying via BYU Pathway Connect in the evening and hoping to earn my degree a few years from now. 

I apologize for the long post but I hope this can inspire one or two readers. If you are struggling with your own testimony of The Church please don't hesitate to reach out to your leaders or even to us here in the sub. And please do not underestimate the power of a sincere prayer.

116,latterdaysaints,"Hello, ex-mo here if that‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôve been having doubts about the church since I was 12, but it wasn‚Äôt until my senior year I found out for myself the church wasn‚Äôt true. After reading the CES letter, and visiting the ex-mo subreddit, I was very positive the church isn‚Äôt what I grew up believing it was. Although I still am positive in my beliefs, I realized I wasn‚Äôt giving the church enough of a chance to prove some of these things wrong.

Similarly to how growing up lds only gave me one perspective of how I saw things, only reading things from an ex-mo perspective is not a good mindset to have as well,and it‚Äôs better to see both sides of the equation. I haven‚Äôt done endowment stuff yet so I don‚Äôt have any personal experiences on stuff like that, although I did do all 4 years of seminary and graduate.

Anyways, here are some questions I‚Äôve had that I‚Äôm hoping for good responses for, whether they support or go against what the church teaches. And if you have any for me as well, I‚Äôll try to answer the best way I can.

1. The translation of the Book of Mormon: hopefully everyone who reads this knows that it was translated using a stone (or seer stone) placed in a hat, where Joseph would put his head in all the way to obscure light and be able to read what it said in order to translate the Book of Mormon. My question regarding this topic is why weren‚Äôt we taught this from the beginning? It wasn‚Äôt until my senior year that I Learned about this and it definitely was my first major catalyst in seriously questioning the church. Also, in the gospel topic essays it is mentioned the stone was used for ‚Äútreasure hunting‚Äù. How could a stone first used to ‚Äúfind treasures‚Äù be able to translate the BoM? 

2. The black priesthood ban: IIRC this was a thing until it was lifted in 1978. Why was this a thing in the first place? To me it was incredibly racist but there may be a valid point to it I‚Äôve never heard.

3. Polygamy: I didn‚Äôt mind this issue in the beginning. However, after reading the gospel topic essay on it and finding out Joseph smith married a 14 year old, it concerns me a lot. Why would he have to marry a 14 year old? I know he was taught to practice it, and I‚Äôm sure there were women his age to practice it with, so why would he choose a young girl? Or did god ask Joseph to marry her and I missed that?

4. The book of Abraham: gospel topic essays mention that the papyrus he used to translate the book isn‚Äôt an actual translation, but are funeral texts. They go on to say that rather than translate, these texts inspired Joseph to write the book of Abraham. Why weren‚Äôt we also taught this? 

5. I‚Äôve watched temple ceremonies on YouTube, so I‚Äôve seen some of the stuff that goes on. This question is In regard to Michael, who I only learned from watching the video created the earth with Jesus. If I‚Äôm not allowed to bring this up bc it involves the temple and isn‚Äôt allowed to be talked about then I apologize in advance, like I‚Äôve said before I‚Äôve never experienced the ceremony first hand. If you can‚Äôt answer just let me know it‚Äôs either a secret or sacred topic to talk about and we can let it go, but why aren‚Äôt we taught about him at all? I don‚Äôt recall the Book of Mormon or any resources mentioning a Michael, much less that he helped create the earth with Jesus.

6. The 100 billion dollars: this is less of a question and more of a personal opinion. Do you believe this is real? If so, what are your thoughts on it? If you don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real, I‚Äôm curious as well.

7. The last question: why doesn‚Äôt the church mention the gospel topic essays? I first heard of them from the Exmormon subreddit. Is there a reason they are keeping quiet about them?

As you can see, a lot of my questions are less to do with the topic at hand but largely the fact that we are not taught these at all. I originally heard about most of these in the CES letter, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. After reading about them on the gospel topic essays is when I knew the church confirmed them as well. I hope you guys respond honestly because that is what I‚Äôm here for. I hope I don‚Äôt get banned for asking these questions because I really want to know your guys perspectives and There is really no other way to find out unless I want to out myself as an ex-mo irl (which I‚Äôm scared to do but that‚Äôs a different story). If you got this far, thanks for reading, it means a lot.",Needing a different perspective

118,latterdaysaints,"So... while I'm 100% in favor of the belief that God is no respecter of persons and ""all are alike unto him"", I feel like the passages in the Book of Mormon and book of Moses beg a question about what really is meant by a ""skin of blackness"".

All we've got is the most recent update to Come Follow Me saying it's not fully understood. While I'm fine with saying former latter-day leaders may have had their own prejudices and the gospel topic essay on Race and the Priesthood seeming to confirm that there's really no known or shared revelation on the early reasons for instituting the priesthood ban, it feels a little too much to go and change what the scriptures say. If the scriptures say that God cursed people with a ""skin of blackness"" to make them less appealing to Nephi's seed, then I'd guess that mark would be pretty obvious and somehow unappealing to them for whatever reason. The other mark setting an unfaithful people apart found in the Book of Mormon were the Amlicites who marked themselves with a red mark on their forehead. 

I guess what I'm saying is ""skin of blackness"" seems pretty straightforward. It feels like what we're getting is a soft ""we don't really understand"" and ""maybe 'skin of blackness' doesn't literally mean dark skin"", but no alternative explanation. I'd rather that the (unpopular) position was that God indeed has appeared in the past to use skin color (and family lineage) as means to separate people and define his chosen people (eg. Gospel not preached to all until the day of Pentecost, etc). It almost feels to me like the current position is just a direct response to the unease and sensitive nature of it instead of being a real explanation. It feels easier to me to say we don't know why God did what he did but do know it's not how it is in our day rather than try to parse things out so much and say we're not sure if that's what the words literally mean.

I'm white. My wife is black. My kids are biracial. They're young, but someday I know they're going to wonder about this. I know many already have. And I'll do what most do: ""by their fruits, ye shall know them"". We don't have all the answers on many things. But I guess what I'm saying is I worry that it's almost that we have changed our position on things to fit the needs of the times and aren't willing to boldly state what seems to be unpopular: God has used skin color at some specific times to mark a wicked people. Feels like we are trying to not attract negative attention rather than just coming out and saying, ""yeah, we think that's how God has done things in the past, because that's what we have in our scriptures, but we know for sure that's a very narrow thing and that skin color today and throughout most of history has had absolutely no relevance to worthiness."" I'd rather we say the scriptures mean what they say and also that it's not an eternal, broadly applicable thing than to try to say the Book of Mormon translation was a bit off in its word choice or something.",Come Follow Me / Skin of Blackness

123,latterdaysaints,"I have just started teaching a mission prep class, which has always been a dream calling for me. However, since my mission has been over for a little over a decade, I was hoping for some help with a couple of questions. 

1. Does anyone know what the Church's updated stance is on how soon one should serve? I used to feel there was a cultural belief that serving a mission was nearly equal to a commandment for men. With the age eligibility change, has that perceived belief loosened up some? Are men, and women, expected to serve as soon as they're eligible or is completing some school first more understood and accepted?

2. More importantly, what do you feel are critical principles to have a clear understanding of before a mission to be best prepared? Do you have good sections from Preach My Gospel or verses of scripture that can be used in tandem with said principle?",Mission Prep Prep
124,latterdaysaints,"I was raised Catholic.  Thus, I was taught about Original Sin and how bad things became for man after they were cast out of Eden.  It was never something that was looked at in a positive light.

Now, as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I see another side of it.

Adam and Eve and everything else lived in unchanging state in the Garden of Eden.  There was no death.  There was also no birth.  It was only after as they were being cast out that the Lord God said: *I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shall bring forth children...* Genesis 3:17

Without the fall, none of the rest of us would have been born.  That makes it pretty crucial, huh.

Another thing I've learned is that not only is the purpose of creation so that I could have a body but more importantly so I could have a family.

Here is a good article on that:

148,latterdaysaints,"I would like some feedback and thoughts regarding Elder Stevenson's comments today as reported in the Salt Lake Tribute in this [article](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/01/21/lds-church-naacp-becoming/). This article reported the following in regards to Elder Stevenson's meeting with NAACP today in Salt Lake City: 

*The church ‚Äúcondemn\[s\] all racism past and present in any form,‚Äù the apostle said, ‚Äúand we disavow any theory that advances that black skin or dark skin is the sign of a curse.‚Äù* 

I am wondering what everyone's thoughts are in regards to this statement being in conflict with verses in the Book of Mormon about the skin of darkness as the mark of the curse (2 Nephi 5, Alma 3). I totally understand and agree with Elder Stevenson's comments about the Church condemning racism and that skin color does not have anything to do with whether you have a cursed ancestry or not, but in the context of the Book of Mormon it is clear that the ""skin of blackness"" was the mark of the curse on the Lamanites (the curse being cut off from the presence of the Lord).

The [revised Come, Follow Me manual for the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/come-follow-me-for-individuals-and-families-book-of-mormon-2020/06?lang=eng) (February 3rd-9th) states the following about this topic:

*What was the curse that came upon the Lamanites?*

*In Nephi‚Äôs day the curse of the Lamanites was that they were ‚Äúcut off from \[the Lord‚Äôs\] presence ‚Ä¶ because of their iniquity‚Äù (*[*2¬†Nephi 5:20‚Äì21*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.20-21?lang=eng#p20)*).  This meant the Spirit of the Lord was withdrawn from their lives. When  Lamanites later embraced the gospel of Jesus Christ, ‚Äúthe curse of God  did no more follow them‚Äù (*[*Alma 23:18*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23.18?lang=eng#p18)*).* 

*The  Book of Mormon also states that a mark of dark skin came upon the Lamanites after the Nephites separated from them. The nature and appearance of this mark are not fully understood. The mark initially  distinguished the Lamanites from the Nephites. Later, as both the  Nephites and Lamanites each went through periods of wickedness and  righteousness, the mark became irrelevant as an indicator of the  Lamanites‚Äô standing before God.* 

*Prophets affirm in our day that dark skin is not a sign of divine disfavor or cursing. The Church embraces Nephi‚Äôs teaching that the Lord ‚Äúdenieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and  female‚Äù (*[*2¬†Nephi 26:33*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#p33)*). President Russell¬†M. Nelson declared: ‚ÄúThe Lord has stressed His essential doctrine of equal opportunity for His children. ‚Ä¶ Differences in culture, language, gender, race, and nationality fade into insignificance as the faithful enter the covenant path and come unto our beloved Redeemer‚Äù (‚Äú*[*President Nelson Remarks at Worldwide Priesthood Celebration*](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-nelson-remarks-worldwide-priesthood-celebration?lang=eng)*‚Äù \[June¬†1, 2018\], newsroom.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).* 

I found this commentary helpful from the revised manual and this seems to be a more thorough explanation of the topic that is accurate to what the Book of Mormon teaches. So what are your thoughts about Elder Stevenson's comments? Granted, he was at a meeting with the NAACP and I think his audience and the context of his comments make it clear that the Church does not teach that skin color matters in regards to the Gospel. However, it concerns me that his comments are not fully accurate with what the Book of Mormon states in regards to this topic, especially since it was this very topic of the Book of Mormon manual that prompted his comments.",Elder Stevenson's Comments about the Mark of the Curse

153,latterdaysaints,"The post earlier today about starting a sacrament meeting talk with a joke made me think about all the crazy/dumb things I have heard people say in their talks. Some of my favorites:

* The standard opening line used by nearly every youth speaker (in my ward, at least): ""For those of you who don't know me, my name is..."" It's as if there is no other way to begin a talk. Please stop! You've already been introduced, your name is in the bulletin, and most people probably know you anyway.
* An introductory statement about how you were assigned to give the talk: ""Last Tuesday night I was sitting at home eating stale pizza when Brother Smith's name showed up on my caller ID. \[Blah blah blah.\]"" No one cares! And giving a talk is like jury duty. If you're smart, you can always find a way out of it.
* A disclaimer (often times with some shade): ""I forgot I had to give a talk until last night so I got up early this morning to prepare this."" Or: ""Brother Smith called me yesterday afternoon and asked me to speak today."" You may as well tell everyone to pull out their phones and do something else for the next 8 minutes.
* Other generally bad ideas: The speaker who compared ward leadership, person-by-person, to the cast of characters in M\*A\*S\*H. Or the speaker giving a final address to the ward before moving who pulled out the ward directory (remember those?) and starting sharing his feelings about every member. He only got to the letter M before running out of time.
* Don't even get me started about testimony meeting. My favorite was the ward member who spent 20 minutes talking about his lawsuit against the bishop and how the bishop wouldn't give him a temple recommend. The bishop (and the stake president) was sitting about five feet away.

157,latterdaysaints,"Hey everyone, I've fallen in love with this religion and this city as I related [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/eqpqk2/thank_you_latter_day_saints/), and there was a piece published in *The Atlantic* this morning that put into sharper relief *why* I think this religion is so wonderful.    


[Every Place Is The Same Now](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/smartphone-has-ruined-space/605077/)  


The title encapsulates everything, and it's something I alluded to in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/eqpqk2/thank_you_latter_day_saints/).  When I realized my dad was abusive and I needed to move on and start all over, what lay before me seemed so bleak; I needed to go somewhere, but *where*?  Every city in the country to my eyes was entirely fungible; it would have a McDonald's on one corner and a Starbucks on the other.  I would spend my time desperately trying to acquire whatever dehumanizing, meager employment I could possibly find, and then eke out a thankless existence for the rest of my life.  There was only one city I could think of that might distinguish itself from the others: Salt Lake City, because I knew of the Church's robust humanitarian services wing.  Well, I turned out to be right in that the Church's *material services* are indeed robust, but what I was delightedly blindsided by was the *soul* of the city, the ethos of service.  People at welfare square didn't just hand you a list of employment and housing resources; they did it with genuine warmth and compassion in their eyes.  They are proud to serve, to help other people.  What I took away from that was more valuable than any handout: the knowledge that, all around you, people who genuinely *care* about other people, just because they *are* people--Children of God--are all around you.   


Now that I've been an active member for a Ward for a few months, I see how special this is, and it reminds me of a cherished time I had thought long gone: my childhood.  But I don't mean the simple, inevitably nostalgia-laced memories of childhood itself, but rather *the way the world was* when I grew up at the end of a long cul de sac in the early 90s.  There were roughly a dozen houses on that block, and *every family knew each other*, and most of them were friends with each other.  Every single day, as the late afternoon became the evening and then night fell, the entire street would be crawling with us kids, all without a care in the world and just enjoying the pleasure of being alive, part of a community.   This is a relic of a time long gone; I haven't known a next door neighbor's *name*  in probably the last fifteen years.    


Why did this happen?  I think it has everything to do with the internet.   One of the reasons you were friendly with the neighbors in the early 90s was because *you had to be*.  Living alone is boring, and all but impossible anyway.  One day, you really would run out of sugar; your car *would* break down when you were supposed to pick a friend up from the airport.  And when it did, nothing could replace the emotional security of knowing that there were actual *people* just next door who would be there to help you when it did.  But even those relationships were borne out of a sort of transactional, instrumental necessity, you would come to genuinely be fond of the neighbors, and genuinely be interested in who they were, where they came from, what they did, and what their children dreamed of.  We all have so much more in common than we do different, because we're all, after all, human.   


But, of course, we don't have *everything* in common, and typically that category comprises our opinions not of what we simply *do,* but what we think people *ought* to do, things typically falling under the umbrella of ""politics"" and ""religion.""  Often, our divergent views on these matters are mutually exclusive, where no compromise is possible even in principle, which is why they can be such explosive topics of conversation.  Explosive, and typically, corrosive.  Arguments over these topics can end in friendships.  In a world where you really might unexpectedly need a ride to work, and when your children played together every day after school, it was too important to destroy what few human relationships you had.    You didn't know who the neighbors were voting for President, because you didn't *want* to know.  Or maybe you wanted to know, but it was risking too much to find out.   


And then along came the internet.  Whereas before, what community you ended up a part of was largely determined by luck--who moved in and who moved out over the years--now, suddenly, ""at your fingertips"" in erstwhile parlance, were entire communities tailor-made to align with your own interests.  At first, this was entirely benign, for a variety of reasons.  One was the primitive technology.  Another was that the novelty of the internet was itself something to commune over--now, instead of telling your neighbor about an awesome restaurant you found, you could tell him about an awesome *website* you had found.  Most decisively, however, was the ultimate superficiality of what the nascent internet communities were based on; they were mostly *hobby* communities.  Gaming, culinary, botany, whatever.  To each his own. 

And then, as technology got more complicated, so too did the country.  The sunny, post-Cold War consensus optimism slowly eroded, reaching its spectacular end in 9/11.  Suddenly, politics was Important again, and the debates that it engendered touched on the most fundamental and therefore polarizing of issues.  Things like sexuality, the role of marriage, and most consequentially, war and peace. Only now your exposure to such things wasn't limited to merely the hour in front of the television after dinner, now you could *participate.* All the time.  Your political identity began to take precedence over all other aspects of your identity, and the same technology that was empowering you to live that way was empowering you also to fulfill the quotidian needs you might one day need to call upon the help of another human being for.  Now, you didn't need your neighbors, *and they didn't need you.*  While you trawled message boards, you wondered what message boards your neighbors might be trawling.  Suddenly, not only didn't you really trust people anymore, *you didn't need to.*   


And that's where we are today.  When we go shopping, we don't see other *people* anymore, we see other *agents*.  Agents we are competing with.  Competing for goods, as we see in the yearly pathetic Black Friday spectacles, but more importantly, agents of competitive ideological change.  Nowadays, I don't really care what my neighbor does for a living, what they aspired to as a child, what their children aspire to now. Now, ominously, all I wonder is, if Civil War broke out, would that person hesitate to kill me?

The contrast with this sad state of affairs is what I find so amazing about this Church.  Almost always now, where people gather, there is the threat of violence in the air.  Even in massive Protestant megachurches, while violence may not be in the air, a disgusting sort of disingenuousness often is, where ""the Gospel"" if often used transparently as a sort of divine rubber stamp of authority of the moral superiority of their views in the political culture wars, and churches increasingly abandon the traditional modes and accoutrements of worship in a desperate attempt to stay ""hip"" and relevant.  *Come to* our *church, because it's not like those* other *churches; it's* cool!  *Don't miss our* very cool *Christian Rock band, and be sure to grab a flyer in the lobby for all of the very* cool *social events we have going on.*   


In a Latter-Day Saint congregation, I feel again that warmth that comes from being with and interacting with other people *not because* they are agents of the particular ideology I happen to share, but simply because they are other *people*\--other Children of God.  Everywhere else..

*Anywhere has become as good as anywhere else. The office is a suitable place for tapping out emails, but so is the bed, or the toilet. You can watch television in the den‚Äîbut also in the car, or at the coffee shop, turning those spaces into impromptu theaters. Grocery shopping can be done via an app while waiting for the kids‚Äô recital to start. Habits like these compress time, but they also transform space. Nowhere feels especially remarkable, and every place adopts the pleasures and burdens of every other. It‚Äôs possible to do so much from home, so why leave at all?*  


And so it is.  Anywhere and everywhere, everything has become fungible.  But not in the LDS Church.  We have personal relationships with other people simply they are people.  These relationships aren't fungible; just like I did with my neighbors when I was a kid, I actually *know* the people in my Ward.  I know who they are, where they came from, what they do, who their children are, and what their children dream of.  And I know that when life kicks me in the butt, as it is wont to inevitably and always do, someone from my Ward will be there to help me.  And when they likewise need me, I'll be there to help them too.   On Sunday mornings, instead of watching *Meet the Press* and watching the world tear itself apart before my eyes, I can watch it come together on a breathtaking broadcast of *Music and the Spoken Word.*  The buildings from which that is performed--the Tabernacle and the Conference Center--most certainly aren't fungible; they're unique.  Testaments not just to the faith and dedication of the Saints 150 years ago, but their continuing vitality a testament to the continued faith of the Saints all the way to the present.  A testament to the fact that, while so many of the rest of the country tear each other part, the Latter-Day Saints will always be there to build each other up, to hang on to something sacred, something wonderful, something Eternal.",Why I'm In Love With Mormonism
158,latterdaysaints,"We of course combined the high priests and elders, and now have 160 members of the elder's quorum.  About 45 attend, 30 have primary callings and we have about 40 who are really less active.

The DC says you should have 96 people in a quorum.  Doctrine aside, I'm wondering if anyone else has split their quorum recently and whether it made things better or worse.   I can see it adding a layer of administration, but on the other hand each EQ president would be focusing on half as many members.

163,latterdaysaints,"Yesterday at SS, we went on the first chapters of the BoM, as you all know, and of course the classic diss on L&amp;L started:

- ""How come they could be SO evil/unfaithful/bad/..., they saw an ANGEL for heaven's sake!""

- ""I know right?? Silly L&amp;L...""

Then, my friend leaned to me in class and whispered that after all is said and done, we tend to be more like L&amp;L than Nephi.

Indeed, aren't we a little hypocritical. If we saw an angel l, would we without a doubt stop doing anything wrong and start a new life of fasting and praying as a monk?

I believe it is dangerous to always emphasize such binary examples like 
1) Godlike perfect Nephi (even Lehi murmured) 

versus 

2) the evil L&amp;L who never did the right thing for more than two days in a row.

Of course, such example of Good vs Bad will be taught in class as they always be (it is way easier to see the world in a black&amp;white view), and I do not suggest we rewrite the story, but it is because of such binary extremes that some of us will always feel like they are not doing enough... 
and let's be honest, according to Nephi's example, NOBODY is ever doing enough.

And because the whole class around them agrees (""OMG they were SO unrighteous!"") and emphasises this extreme, then it is easy for one to see him/herself as a lonely awful sinner amidst overly perfect LDS for being a normal and imperfect human.

Anyway, just wanted to share this.
Perhaps we ought to stop gratuitously judging instances of wrong behavior in the scriptures and instead take example from them and look at ourselves to become better, knowing that we have the same very weaknesses?

Any thoughts on this?",Let us not be too hard on Laman et Lemuel... maybe?

One of my friends has been taking them since October and is finally getting baptized this coming Sunday!!! I‚Äôm so happy for her. 

That being said, I work closely with the missionaries and we get to talk a lot. A few nights ago I was waiting at the church for a friend to be done with an interview with the bishop and the elders also happened to be waiting for the bishop. Transfers recently happened and the particular elder I am talking about has been in our ward since October and isn‚Äôt leaving our ward until the end of his mission in April. We have been merely aquatints. Anyway, we were sitting in the waiting room outside of the bishops office and his companion had to take a call and stepped to the other side of the room and was not listening to a thing we were saying. We got to talking and somehow we started talking about repentance and the overall joy it brings. Then I shared about my long experience with repentance and how difficult it has been for me but I have never felt happier and just overall content in my entire life. He started to tear up and laugh a little because he understood exactly what I went through. We talked about it for a while and we both started to tear up. He shared Moroni 2:41 (those who follow the commandments feel joy and are blessed) with me and 10/10 recommend. Definitely brought us closer together but I am not sure if it was an appropriate conversation to have on my part with an elder especially since we weren‚Äôt really being heard.

Flash forward to today, I was wearing a new dress ( and I looked absolutely gorgeous) and when he saw me he lit up. I‚Äôm not just saying that, his whole demeanor changed. He looked at me like I was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. I felt like a queen. After church we talked for a little while and by the end of the conversation I definitely fell for him, super hard. Couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I keep telling myself to get over it and by the time I had finally gone to my friends house and stopped thinking about it, the elders showed up. For some reason he just kept fist bumping me with the little pow sound at the end. It was pretty funny but man oh man I am completely head over heels for this elder. How am I supposed to act now?

169,latterdaysaints,"Our ministering brothers (adult and YM--not his son) have never talked to myself or husband about being our ministering brothers since the program began nearly 2 years ago. We can see on the Member Tools app who they are 

It makes me sad that they have missed two opportunities the past two months to minister to my husband. 

My husband's father passed away 5 days before Christmas. This past Thursday my husband had emergency surgery and is home recovering now for the next couple of weeks.

My husband did not feel comfortable asking the adult ministering brother for a blessing after his surgery, because we have no relationship with him, though our sons are friends. It is awkward to us to tell them anything because be they have never made contact, and yes, they are both very active. I don't expect the YM to do anything as he is still young and he doesn't minister with his own father who is inactive.

At one of these meetings after the organization of the school, (the  school being organized on the 23rd of January, 1833, when we were all  together, Joseph having given instructions, and while engaged in silent  prayer, kneeling, with our hands uplifted each one praying in silence,  no one whispered above his breath, a personage walked through the room  from east to west, and Joseph asked if we saw him. I saw him and suppose  the others did and Joseph answered that is  Jesus, the Son of God, our elder brother. Afterward Joseph told us to  resume our former position in prayer, which we did. Another person came  through; he was surrounded as with a flame of fire. He (Brother Coltrin)  experienced a sensation that it might destroy the tabernacle as it was  of consuming fire of great brightness. The Prophet Joseph said this was  the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. I saw Him.  
 

When asked about the kind of clothing the  Father had on, Brother Coltrin said: I did not discover his clothing for  he was surrounded as with a flame of fire, which was so brilliant that I  could not discover anything else but his person. I saw his hands, his  legs, his feet, his eyes, nose, mouth, head and body in the shape and  form of a perfect man. He sat in a chair as a man would sit in a chair,  but this appearance was so grand and overwhelming that it seemed I  should melt down in his presence, and the sensation was so powerful that  it thrilled through my whole system and I felt it in the marrow of my  bones. The Prophet Joseph said: Brethren, now you are prepared to be the  apostles of Jesus Christ, for you have seen both the Father and the Son  and know that they exist and that they are two separate personages.  
 

This appearance occurred about two or three weeks after the opening of  the school. After the Father had passed through, Joseph told us to again  take our positions in prayer. We did so, and in a very short time he  drew our attention and said to us that Brother Reynolds Cahoon was about  to leave us, and told us to look at him. He (Brother Cahoon) was on his  knees and his arms were extended, his hands and wrists, head, face and  neck down to his shoulders were as a piece of amber, clear and  transparent, his blood having apparently left his veins. Upon the  attention of the brethren being thus called to Brother Cahoon, the  change seemed to pass away and Joseph said that in a few minutes more,  Brother Cahoon would have left us, but he came to himself again.

\[A\]fter the organization of the Pontiac \[Michigan\] Branch of the  Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. Saints, in 1834, we had the pleasure of  having a visit from the Prophet Joseph Smith: a plain but noble looking  man, of large frame and about 6 feet high. With him was his Father,  Joseph Smith, and Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, whose  sister Sophia Kellog lived in our settlement.  
 

A great stir was made in this settlement at so distinguished  visitors the meetings held were crowded to see and hear the testimonies  given which were powerful I will here relate my own experience on the  occasion of a meeting in our old log school House The Prophet stood at a  table for the pulpit where he began relating his vision and before he  got through he was in the midst of the congregation with uplifted hand.  I do believe that there was not one person present,... at the time...  who was not convicted of the truth of his vision,...his countenance  seemed to me to assume a heavenly whiteness and his voice was so...  forcible for my part it so impressed me as to become indelibly imprinted  in my mind....  
 

The visit of this man of God to our house ... left a lasting  remembrance with us and will stand as a witness against those who were  so favored above many.  
 

  In that same year, 1834, in the midst of  many large congregations, the Prophet testified with great power  concerning the visit of the Father and the Son, and the conversation he  had with them. Never before did I feel such power as was manifested on  these occasions.

# ""What does it mean to Deny The Holy Ghost?""

# The Prophet Joseph Smith

‚ÄúAll sins shall be forgiven except the sin against the Holy Ghost; for Jesus will save all except the sons of perdition. What must a man do to commit the unpardonable sin? He must receive the Holy Ghost, have the heavens opened unto him, and **know God**, and then sin against him. After a man has sinned against the Holy Ghost, there is no repentance for him. He has got to say that the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened unto him, and to deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth of it; and from that time he begins to be an enemy. This is the case with many apostates of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When a man begins to be an enemy to this work, he hunts me; he seeks to kill me, and never ceases to thirst for my blood. He gets the spirit of the Devil-- the same spirit that they had who crucified the Lord of Life,--the same spirit that sins against the Holy Ghost. You cannot save such persons; you cannot bring them to repentance: they make open war like the Devil, and awful is the consequence.‚Äù (Teachings, pg. 358)

*\[If a requirement to commit the unpardonable sin of denying the Holy Ghost is to ‚Äúknow God‚Äù, what does it mean ‚Äúknow God‚Äù? Does it take more than 1 prompting of whisper of the Holy Ghost to know Him? If so, it seems to me that it‚Äôs harder to actually commit the unpardonable sin of denying the Holy Ghost than you have explained to me. Does a simple whisper of the Spirit constitute someone having their ‚Äúeyes open to the truth of the‚Äù Plan of Salvation?\]*

# President Spencer W. Kimball

‚ÄúThe sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly **impossible for the rank and file to commit such a sin**‚Äù (The Miracle of Forgiveness \[1969\], 123).

*\[This one is self-explanatory. President Kimball, like myself &amp; Joseph Smith, believes that there is a certain level of knowledge required to be able to deny the Holy Ghost, far beyond a simple witness from the Spirit.\]*

# D&amp;C 132:27

The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye **commit murder wherein ye shed innocent blood**, and **assent unto my death**, **after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant**, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord.

*\[It seems that the Lord is either figuratively or literally comparing the sin of denying the Holy Ghost to murder. That comparison aside, the Lord says one must ‚Äú****assent (agree with).. my death****,* ***after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant‚Äù*** *in order to blaspheme (deny) against the Holy Ghost****.*** *Here again, the Lord puts a greater requirement of knowledge (receiving the new and everlasting covenant) in order to commit the unpardonable sin of denying the Holy Ghost.\]*

# BYU.EDU (and other Gospel resources included)

Alma identified denying the Holy Ghost as the most abominable sin. According to the Lord, individuals committing this sin do five things: (1) They ‚Äúknow my power, and \[2\] have been made partakers thereof, and \[3\] suffered themselves through the power of the devil to be overcome and \[4\] to deny the truth and \[5\] defy my power‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:31). **The key to these requirements appears to be the power of the priesthood**.

An individual must bear and be a partaker of the priesthood and then defy that power. This leads that man to deny ‚Äúthe Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father, having crucified him unto themselves and put him to open shame‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:35). Joseph Smith indicated that such an individual must ‚Äúhave the heavens opened unto him, and know God, and then sin against Him.. He has got to say that the sun does not shine while he sees it; he has got to deny Jesus Christ when the heavens have been opened unto him, and to deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth of it‚Äù (*Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith* 358; hereafter *TPJS).* Thus they become Sons of Perdition. These qualifications limit those who receive this judgment. A person must have made priesthood covenants with God and then have received knowledge and power beyond what the vast majority of us have received. Spencer W. Kimball stated, ‚ÄúThe sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly impossible for the rank and file to commit such a sin‚Äù (*Teachings* 23).

*\[Right off the bat, BYU/Church approved sources are confirming that there are scripturally several requirements that a person must fulfill in order to commit the unpardonable of denying the Holy Ghost.. One specifically being that someone has partaken of Priesthood power through ordination or temple covenants. Do you believe this?\]*

This knowledge must be gained in mortality. An individual cannot become a Son of Perdition in the postmortal spirit world. Joseph Smith taught, ‚ÄúA man cannot commit the unpardonable sin after the dissolution of the body‚Äù (*TPJS* 357). However, if a mortal today gains **sufficient** knowledge, light, and truth, and then turns against that illumination and denies what he knows, he has committed the unpardonable and non-redemptive sin, he will be cast into outer darkness forever.

*\[There it is again.* ***Sufficient*** *knowledge, light and truth.. This implies that there are different levels or degrees of knowledge, light and truth. And that only after receiving a certain amount can an individual qualify for denying the Holy Ghost.\]*

Once individuals deny the Holy Ghost, the penalty is final. The Lord declared that these were the ones for ‚Äúwhom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:34). Alma taught that all sins are pardonable except the sin against the Holy Ghost: **‚ÄúFor behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once had a place in you and ye know that ye deny it, behold this is a sin which is unpardonable‚Äù (Alma 39:6).** For a sin to be unpardonable, it must be of such a nature that it would not be covered by the atoning blood of the Savior, nor could the personal suffering of the sinner pay the price for the broken law. All other sins can be covered by either of these methods and, therefore, are pardonable.

*\[This verse in the Book of Mormon seems to imply that it‚Äôs possible for someone to deny the Holy Ghost without knowing it. Denying it and knowing you are denying it seems to be a requirement. ‚ÄúFor a sin to be unpardonable, it must be of such a nature..‚Äù -- So the question must be asked. Is it possible for someone to go against the promptings of the Holy Ghost to a nature or degree that is not unpardonable and ‚Äúwould not be covered by the atoning blood of the Savior, nor could the personal suffering of the sinner pay the price for the broken law‚Äù? This resource seems to think so.\]*

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: ‚ÄúThe unpardonable sin is to shed innocent blood, or be accessory thereto. All other sins will be visited with the judgment in the flesh, and the spirit being delivered to the buffetings of Satan until the day of the Lord Jesus‚Äù (*TPJS* 301). In his sermons the Prophet used the term ‚Äúinnocent blood‚Äù in relation to both the sin against the Holy Ghost and murder. **In relationship with the sin against the Holy Ghost, this apparently refers to those who have rebelled against the Savior that they seek after the blood of Christ and if possible would shed his blood anew**.

*\[Is this another requirement Joseph has revealed is necessary for someone who commits the unpardonable sin? It sure seems so. It doesn‚Äôt seem like simply turning away from the Holy Ghost‚Äôs promptings constitutes becoming a Son of Perdition. There is more required.\]*

*\[The rest of the article is not pertinent to my viewpoint, but is interesting nonetheless.\]*

Because the sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable, no redemption will be made through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Therefore, no glory will be inherited by these people. President Joseph Fielding Smith said: ‚ÄúIt is the purpose of the Almighty to save all mankind, and all will enter into his kingdoms in some degree of glory, except sons of perdition who sin beyond the power of repentance and redemption, and therefore cannot receive forgiveness of sins. All the rest shall be saved, but not all with the same degree of glory or exaltation‚Äù (2:21).

The unpardonable nature of this sin is such that ‚Äúit had been better for them never to have been born‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:32). They become the ‚Äúvessel of wrath‚Äù and the only ones ‚Äúon whom the second death shall have any power.‚Äù They are the ‚Äúonly ones who shall not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:32‚Äì38). If they have lived on this earth and have received a mortal body, they shall come forth in the last resurrection with an immortal body; but that body will not be glorified. Instead they ‚Äúgo away into the lake of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:36), ‚Äúinto everlasting punishment, which is endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to reign with the devil and his angels in eternity, where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is their torment‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:44). Only those who commit this sin will know the nature of this torment and its duration:

The end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be unto man, except to those who are made partakers thereof; . . . wherefore, the end, the width, height, depth, and the misery thereof, they understand not, neither any man except those who are ordained unto this condemnation. (D&amp;C 76:45‚Äì46, 48)

However, it is important to note that although no human knows the eternal state of these people, it would be incorrect to teach that there is possible redemption for them at some future time. In response to such doctrine taught by a Brother Hulet, Joseph Smith wrote:

Say to the brothers Hulet and to all others, that the Lord never authorized them to say that the devil, his angels, or the sons of perdition, should ever be restored; for their state of destiny was not revealed to man, is not revealed, nor ever shall be revealed, save to those who are made partakers thereof: consequently those who teach this doctrine have not received it of the Spirit of the Lord We, therefore, command that this doctrine be taught no more in Zion. (*TPJS* 24)

Therefore, if mortals today gain **sufficient knowledge, light, and truth**, and then turned against that illumination and deny what they know, they will have committed the unpardonable and non-redemptive sin, and will be cast into outer darkness forever. Denying the Holy Ghost is an unpardonable sin, thus differing in a key aspect from the sin of murder by the shedding of innocent blood.‚Äù (H. Dean Garrett, ‚ÄúThe Three Most Abominable Sins,‚Äù in The Book of Mormon: Alma, the Testimony of the Word, ed. Monte S. Nyman and Charles D. Tate Jr. (Provo, UT: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1992), 157‚Äì71.

# Conclusion

*You have claimed that simply turning away from the Gospel after receiving a simple testimony of it by the power of the Holy Ghost constitutes committing an unpardonable sin. As seen from the evidence above, it is doctrinally correct to say that Denying the Holy Ghost as unpardonable sin is much more difficult to do than you have described to me.*

*To wrap up, here is a summary of requirements listed above for an individual to commit the unpardonable sin of Denying the Holy Ghost:*

1. Such an individual must **know God.**
2. Such an individual must unequivocally ‚Äú**say that the sun does not shine while he sees it**‚Äù -- in the sense of Gospel truth.
3. Such an individual must have the ‚Äú**heavens opened unto him**‚Äù, and to 
4. Such an individual must ‚Äú**deny the plan of salvation with his eyes open to the truth of it**‚Äù.
5. ‚ÄúThe sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly **impossible for the rank and file to commit such a sin**‚Äù.
6. Such an individual must **agree with Christ‚Äôs being put to death**, **after they have received God‚Äôs new and everlasting covenant.**
7. According to the Lord, individuals committing the unpardonable sin of denying the Holy Ghost do five things: (1) They ‚Äúknow my power, and \[2\] have been made partakers thereof, and \[3\] suffered themselves through the power of the devil to be overcome and \[4\] to deny the truth and \[5\] defy my power‚Äù (D&amp;C 76:31). **The key to these requirements appears to be the power of the priesthood**. **A person must have made priesthood covenants** with God and then have received knowledge and power beyond what the vast majority of us have received. 
8. Such an individual must obtain **sufficient** knowledge, light, and truth before denying the Holy Ghost.
9. Such an individual must **know they are denying the Holy Ghost.**
10. Such an individual must **rebel against the Savior &amp; seek after the blood of Christ and, if possible, would shed His blood again.**

The End.",The Unpardonable Sin of Denying the Holy Ghost is Available to All Church Members? - My Response
189,latterdaysaints,"I've felt this pull the last year, trying to tug me back to the church. A tug I never thought would come back after I left at 18. I converted on my own at age 13 without my family. At 15 I was put in foster care was nearly adopted by my best friends family (members of the church) I lived there from 15-18 years old and due to my bio families influences, I started to sin. I tried smoking weed and I drank alcohol a little bit. When my soon to be adoptive family found out, I was kicked to the curb. The family spread so many rumors about me throughout the church, I came out of the closet as a lesbian, and I vowed I'd never go back to church. I couldn't believe any God would allow that all to happen to me at 17 for a couple small sins.

I am now 24, a pothead, a lesbian in a bad relationship for the past 5 years, and feel something missing. I miss being a good person. I did a lot of service, I felt I belonged, I worked hard in everything I did, and I was happy when I was in the church. I want that back. 

I recently decided I am not a lesbian, but rather bisexual, and I would like to leave my relationship to be with a man eventually instead, and not give into same sex attraction (though I in no way think it is wrong, I just want to have a traditional family and feel I personally made the choice to be a lesbian) I'm poor so I can't just leave her, as we would both end up homeless.

Im sure this is confusing. My point is, I want to be a part of the church community again. It's been 6 years since I left and my life has gone in circles. I want my direction back. I want guidance. I want to be a good person. I want my patriarchal blessings to come through. I don't necessarily agree with everything the church teaches anymore but I want to be a part of it. I plan to get out of my relationship eventually and start going back to church. But it's going to be a long road before then. Even knowing I'm sinning by smoking weed and cigarettes for instance, isn't enough to make me stop. I don't feel like I used to. I used to follow all the rules hardcore and believe if I did I would get all these blessings. I didn't get the blessings. I got thrown out. So I felt it was wrong at the time. 

Now that things are still getting worse, I think I left before my blessings panned out or something. I don't know. I started praying and stuff but the real thing that kept me locked in was the community, and I can't have that in my life right now. I dont live in the same area so it would be a new stake when I do go, and I'm just so afraid for being judged or rumors spread again. Any advice for me?",Coming back after 6 years

I wasn't really able to contribute during Sunday school but I still found it very interesting - we were analyzing the symbolic language in some of the scriptures. I was given a Book of Mormon too to take home.

I was invited to go back next week by quite a few people, and I probably will. Even if I don't see myself getting baptized, I still find it valuable to learn about the church in ways I can't really do online. Where would you advise I go from here?

The background, I (32F) was in a crappy part of the US, with lackluster and out of touch/date leadership. Some really poor decisions were made after a major crime was committed (in short, leadership didn‚Äôt understand it was a crime) and no one went to jail. Although I was the injured party I was not/am not in a position to pursue charges or legal action. Someone FINALLY got excommunicated, but it took four years and more risky behavior before that happened. 

For a while, I stepped away from church because I knew my relationship with God would not survive if I kept trying to go to that unit/stake. I‚Äôve moved, but still have wounds. I‚Äôm trying to decide how to reintegrate. I believe in some very basic doctrines, and this is NOT a post about doctrine, but rather how to navigate the culture and administration of the church. 

Has anyone else been in a similar circumstance of wanting to go back to church after feeling really betrayed? How did you do it authentically? I feel like if I have to take a Xanax to sit through church, it‚Äôs not the church for me, BUT I still long for community, a sense of spiritual fulfillment and rejuvenation.

In nameless ways be good and kind,
But never force the human mind.

Freedom and reason make us men;
Take these away, what are we then?

214,latterdaysaints,"Hello Brothers and Sisters,  


I was raised by an emotionally abusive father, a textbook malignant narcissist.  The thing about being an abuse victim is that you don't process your abuse as \*abuse.\*  Sure, you know your parent is a hypocritical bully who can't withstand even the hint of criticism without exploding in all-consuming rage, but to you, that's just ""the way things are.""  But it's more than that; you also continue living under his abusive thumb because you \*blame yourself\* for the way he is.  You tell yourself that, one day, when you can just figure out that perfect permutation of behaviors--perfectly walk that tightrope everything will be okay and your parent will finally \*love you\* again.   


Well, thanks to an incredibly long and convoluted series of events that I can't recount here, I at last became aware that my father didn't love me and that I needed to move on.  But there was a problem--my emotionally abusive father was wealthy, and had basically been offsetting his negligent/pathological parenting with material largesse.  I was both materially spoiled and emotionally stunted--in other words, I didn't have a clue how the word really works and how to make my way in it.  So when it came time to move on from my abusive dad, I was alone.  Really and truly alone.  Where would I go?  What would I do?  Each city in America seemed interchangeable to me--I would get there, eke out an existence while I looked for a job flipping burgers, which I would surely inevitably find, and then live a miserable existence for the rest of my life.   


Except for one city. I'm one of those people who is constantly going from ""deep dive"" to ""deep dive"" on a given topic.  One month, it'll be the Titanic; the next month, the American Revolution.  One such deep dive I had engaged in in the past was Mormonism, which entailed reading all about their robust humanitarian services wing.  As such, there was one, and only one city, that I might not be merely just a city, but also a sort of Zion: Salt Lake City.  And so it was that in the early morning hours of a night in  December of 2018 I stepped off an Amtrak train and into the next phase of my life.  Through family, I had arrangements at the downtown Motel 6 for roughly a week, and for the first day or so did the ""tourist"" thing, which at that time entailed seeing the lights at Temple Square.  I happened to be wearing my Los Angeles Rams beanie that night and ran into a guy wearing a Los Angeles Rams Santa hat.  We quickly struck up a conversation and the topic turned to where I came from, so I told him my situation.  He, totally unsolicited, gave me the name of a bishop who might be able to help me.  The bishop turned out to be the bishop of a Ward downtown mainly serving vagrant individuals.  They were hosting a Christmas party in the coming week or so and invited me. I decided to go.   


I mentioned that my father was wealthy, and indeed he was: my entire life I had travelled across the country attending hundreds glamorous sporting events, particularly NBA and NFL games, often in luxury suites.  But I will always remember that Christmas party as one of the greatest, most meaningful nights of my life.  There was just something so sweet and true about us relative strangers--many of them homeless--gathered there, pretending for just one night at least that everything was okay, as we sang Christmas hymns and shared a meal together.     


At the conclusion of the party, I spoke to the bishop and told him my situation; he immediately referred me to work at Deseret Manufacturing, no questions asked, and I started about a week later.  The work itself was fairly menial, but the \*workplace\* was anything but.  At Deseret Manufacturing, you weren't/aren't just a fungible cog in a capitalist enterprise; you're a \*person.\*  You're working for the Church, of course, but \*they're\* also working \*for you.\*  You're assigned a Development Counselor who personally engages and assesses your strengths and helps point you toward a future career.  The development counselors also have university training in mental health and provide mental health counselling as needed, all for free.  It was working here that I realized something: Everyone always makes fun of what Mormons believe, but then appends ""but they're really nice people,"" as if it were just some weird quirk about Mormons.  But now I realized: Mormons are ""really nice people"" \*because\* of what they believe, chief among them this: Every human being is, before they are anything else--white, black, male, female, liberal, conservative, tall, short, whatever--is a \*Child of God.\*  We are all endowed with the dignity and potential of our Heavenly Father. Everyone always laments that self-identified Christians often don't act so Christ-like. Meanwhile, it's the religious sect so often derided as ""not real Christians"" who actually Preach The Gospel With Words If Necessary.   


It's been over a year now since I arrived to Salt Lake City.  Since then, I've moved through the Deseret ""Ecosystem"" as I like to call it and now am living relatively comfortably in an apartment with my now-wife.  It will surprise none of you to learn that I am now a Latter Day Saint myself--other people's mileage may vary, but I found it all but impossible to \*not\* be captivated by this Gospel.  With the world crumbling to pieces around us, it almost feels like the way Mormons live is the ""solution"" for human community, and the great secret is Love.  Not Love in the sense of showering people with ooey-gooey affection or even giving them ""stuff,"" but giving them something even more important, perhaps the most important thing of all: a Chance.  A chance to move on and overcome their past and actualize themselves.  To realize their inherent Divine potential that we all have as Children of God.  


Two weeks ago at Fast + Testimony meeting I shared my gratitude with my ward, and I want to extend it to the larger Latter-Day Saint Community as well.  Even if you weren't directly involved in my journey, you actually were, by setting such a beautiful example living this Gospel.  And I know tithing can feel brutal sometimes, but the Deseret Manufacturing/Deseret Industries operation absolutely wouldn't be possible without it, so you \*can\* feel secure knowing that your money really does change lives.  It changed mine, and I certainly know it was changing the lives of the hundreds of North African and Middle Eastern refugees I worked with at Deseret Industries, as well. I'm presently looking to write a book based on my experience; this Church has been derided and mocked for far too long, and I think it's time people gave it a fresh look.    


Thank you Heavenly Father, thank you for restoring the Gospel through Joseph Smith, and thank you, Latter-Day Saints!  ""These deeds shall thy memorial be.""

Now, this is amazing information. Hang in here with me and don't miss the last few paragraphs of this post!!!

M. Russell Ballard, ‚ÄúMargaret McNeil Ballard‚Äôs Legacy of Faith,‚Äù Ensign, Jul 1989, 16

She walked across the plains, then helped her family and her new community survive.

On  a spring morning in 1854, the McNeil family stood by the sea to watch   eight-year-old Margaret be baptized. It was so early that they had   carried a lantern on their walk from the little village of Tranent,   Scotland. The water was chilly as Margaret stepped into the sea with her   father.

‚ÄúAs I came up out of the  water,‚Äù she later wrote, ‚Äúthe day was just  beginning to dawn and the  light to creep over the eastern hills. It was a  very beautiful sight,  one that I shall never forget. At this time I was  filled with a sweet  heavenly spirit which has remained with me to this  day.‚Äù (Autobiography  of Margaret McNeil Ballard, pp. 1‚Äì2.)

More  than a century and a quarter later, I, too, feel something of that   heavenly spirit whenever I read about my great-grandmother Margaret   McNeil Ballard, whose faith and tenacity have brought eternal blessings   to me and others of her posterity.

Several  years after she was baptized, Margaret and her family emigrated  to be  with the Saints. They joined a wagon company and settled in Cache   Valley, where Margaret married Henry Ballard. Margaret was Relief   Society president for thirty years; Henry was bishop for thirty-nine.

In  1979, I was privileged to speak in the rededicatory service of the   Logan Temple. Standing in that holy building, I felt close to my noble   great-grandparents, who had helped build and furnish it and who had   served there faithfully for many years. Great-grandmother Margaret led   the group of sisters that wove thousands of yards of fine rag carpeting   to cover the floors of the Logan Temple. Great-grandfather Henry hauled   the first load of sand used to build that temple. Then, as bishop, he   wrote many recommends for its dedication in 1884.

I  believe that Heavenly Father binds us to our kindred dead in many   ways. I feel bound to Great-grandmother Ballard by the priesthood   sealing ordinances. I also feel bound to her faith, which I have learned   about through her own written words and those of other family members   who have recorded her history.

Margaret  was just ten when her family left Scotland and started for  Utah. ‚ÄúI  was ‚Ä¶ somewhat of a venturesome spirit,‚Äù she wrote. (Except  where  noted, all quotations are from Margaret Ballard‚Äôs autobiography.)  The  journey held more than enough drama to suit her. From Liverpool to  New  York, she cooked for and took care of her seasick family. Later, all   the McNeil children except Margaret caught the measles.

Once,  the McNeil wagon was delayed by runaway oxen, but Margaret was  sent  ahead to join the main part of the company with four-year-old James   strapped to her back. That evening, she recorded, ‚ÄúA kind lady helped   me take my brother off my back and I sat up and held him on my lap.‚Äù In   the morning, people in the company shared bacon and bread with her and   James.

Margaret carried her  precious load for about a week. ‚ÄúEach morning one  of the men would  write a note and put it in the slit of a willow stuck  into the ground,  to tell how we were getting along. In this way mother  knew that we were  alright.‚Äù

After the family was  together again, Margaret was charged with caring  for the family cow.  Wakening early, she would hurry the cow ahead of the  company so it  could eat in the grassy places along the way. Then, as  the company  caught up with and passed her, she would hurry the cow along  to catch  up. ‚ÄúBeing alone much of the time,‚Äù she wrote, ‚ÄúI had to get  across the  rivers the best I could. Our cow was a Jersey and had a long  tail.  When it was necessary to cross the rivers I would wind the end of  the  cow‚Äôs tail around my hand and swim across ‚Ä¶ with the cow.‚Äù

One  evening when she was looking for the cow, she felt something soft   under her bare feet. She looked down and found to her horror that she   was standing in a bed of snakes. ‚ÄúAt the sight of them I became so weak I   could scarcely move,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúAll I could think of was to pray,  and  in some way I jumped out of them.‚Äù Whether it was escaping from  Indians  or finding a lost animal, Margaret continually sought and  acknowledged  the Lord‚Äôs protecting care.

After  arriving in Utah, the family‚Äîpenniless and almost starving‚Äîcamped  near  the outskirts of Ogden. While her father went into town to look for   work, Margaret went to a nearby house to beg for food. ‚ÄúI  knocked at  the door and an old lady came and said, ‚ÄòCome in, come in, I  knew you  were coming and have been told to give you food.‚Äô ‚Äù The  woman gave her a  loaf of fresh bread to take to her family and soon  came herself to  bring the McNeils a hot meal. ‚ÄúThe woman was surely  inspired of the  Lord to help us,‚Äù wrote Margaret.

On  their way from Ogden to Cache Valley, the  McNeil family met Henry  Ballard, who was returning from general  conference in Salt Lake City.  He helped the McNeils along their way.  Margaret recorded, ‚ÄúI was a  little barefooted, sun-burned girl, driving  my cow along the country  road, but it was made known to my mother and to  \[Henry\] at that time  that I would someday be his wife.‚Äù She married  Henry less than two  years later, when she was fifteen.

After  the family reached Logan in October 1859, the McNeils built a log   house, with doors and windows made of woven willow branches plastered   with clay. All that winter, Margaret carried the family‚Äôs water from the   river three blocks away. She had no shoes, and her feet, even wrapped   in rags, left bloodstains on the snow.

In  the spring, she drove the cattle while her father held the plow to   break ground for the first crops planted in Logan. ‚ÄúI have seen the   heavens darkened with the grasshoppers until one would think it was   midnight,‚Äù she recalled. She would use willow branches to drive the   grasshoppers into trenches and then bury them alive.

Perhaps  it was her own plentiful hardships that attuned Margaret so  keenly to  others in difficulty. A few years after her marriage, when she  was  expecting their first child, Henry and Margaret were raising a fine   steer to sell in order to buy material for baby clothes. One day Henry   came home and told Margaret that a family they knew in Logan had   suffered a great financial loss and that the townspeople had been called   upon to support them.

The  Ballards had a winter‚Äôs supply of food, but no money, and only the   steer to sell. She was disappointed but said, ‚ÄúGive it, Henry, we will   find some way.‚Äù After Henry left the house, she found two of his old   homespun woolen shirts. ‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ pulled down the blinds ‚Ä¶ so that no one   would see me try my hand at a new art, I spread the shirts on the floor   and without a pattern cut out two little dresses and sewed them by  hand.  This was about all the clothes I had for my first child.‚Äù

Margaret‚Äôs  greatest sorrows were the deaths of five of her eleven  children. But  even in this, the Lord did not fail her. Ten days before  her daughter  Ella died, Margaret had a dream concerning her children  that she could  not interpret. After Ella‚Äôs death, Margaret went to the  temple to  complete ordinance work for her. While there, she prayed to  know the  meaning of her dream and was given a vision. ‚ÄúI was shown that  my five  beautiful children were saved and that they would be mine again.  This  was a great comfort to me, and I felt to praise my God for taking  them,  that through loosing them I might have them again.‚Äù

Several  years earlier, Margaret had received another spiritual blessing  after a  great trial. She had become ill during a pregnancy and was  confined to  her bed. She had previously lost two children in infancy and  had had  several miscarriages. One day, when Henry took the children to  see a  parade, Margaret raised herself from her bed and crawled to the  door to  lock it so that she could pray undisturbed. Calling to remembrance her  willingness to bear children, she begged for help and asked to know her  standing before God.

‚ÄúA voice  spoke plainly to her, saying, ‚ÄòBe of good cheer. Your life is   acceptable, and you will bear a son who will become an Apostle of the   Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äô ‚Äù (Sketches from the Life of Margaret McNeil   Ballard, p. 3.) Margaret recovered and bore a healthy son, Melvin   Joseph, whom she gave to the work of the Lord. Although Margaret   recorded this experience, she never revealed it. Family members   discovered it in her personal papers after her death. In 1919, Melvin J.   Ballard was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles‚Äîa year after   his mother died.

Great-grandmother  Ballard also used the spiritual gift of healing, as  she had been  promised in her patriarchal blessing. She recorded that  once, when her  husband lay near death, she heard a voice instruct her to  pray for him.  Feeling timid about doing so because he had just been  administered to,  she hesitated. But when the voice came twice more, she  obeyed. ‚ÄúThe  Spirit of the Holy Ghost was  with me and I was filled with a Divine  strength,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWhen I had  finished my husband had gone to sleep  and slept quietly.‚Äù She also  recorded incidents when her son Melvin  and her son Henry were healed  through her faith.

Through  a lifetime of following the Spirit‚Äôs promptings, Margaret  developed an  unwavering faith. When her son Melvin J. was presiding over  the  Northwestern States Mission, she visited him in Portland, Oregon.  Among  her most gratifying experiences was attending street meetings with  the  missionaries, bearing her testimony to ‚Äúthrongs of people crowded  in  the streets.‚Äù She wrote, ‚ÄúIn my weak way I feel that I have assisted  in  the spread of truth.‚Äù

A Church  Patriarch,  Zebedee Coltrin was in Logan, to help with the  dedication  of the Logan Temple. Recognize that name? He had been a  personal friend  of the Prophet Joseph in Kirtland, and Nauvoo. He was a  member of the  School of the Prophets. He was one of the President's of  the Seventy.  He had the following AMAZING EXPERIENCES!

Zebedee  was present in the first few weeks  of the School of the Prophets when  this happened. The Father and the Son  visited.(The Prophet Joseph said:  Brethren, now you are prepared to be  the apostles of Jesus Christ, for  you have seen both the Father and the  Son) here is more. This time  directly from the Ensign. This event is  corroborated by John Murdock,  missionary companion of Zebedee Coltrin at  the time and also present at  the meeting.[https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/01/hous](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/01/hous) ... n?lang=eng

Zebedee saw a vision of the Savior on the cross while in the Kirtland Temple.

Also  in 1834, Coltrin joined Zion's Camp (contributing financially all  he  had) and marched with the Prophet Joseph and more than 200 others ‚Äî a   journey from Ohio to Missouri ‚Äî for the purpose of assisting and   protecting the Missouri Latter Day Saints who had recently been forcibly   expelled from Jackson County by mobs. The Camp was divided into twelve   companies, and Zebedee was appointed cook for Joseph Smith's company.  An  indicator of the trust Smith had for Coltrin is found in Joseph's   remark that he would 'not eat or drink anything but what Zebedee   prepared' for him. Stephens, 1974, p. 50

19  April 1834, Joseph Smith, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery gave   Zebedee a blessing at New Portage (now Barberton), Ohio, that he would   live to see 70 years of age and be blessed with wisdom to preach the   gospel.The Joseph Smith Papers, Journals, Volume 1, 1832 -1839, pages 41   - 42

Once after returning from a  mission, he \[Zebedee Coltrin\] met Brother  Joseph in Kirtland, who  asked him if he did not wish to go with him to a  conference at New  Portage. The party consisted of Presidents Joseph  Smith, Sidney Rigdon,  Oliver Cowdery and myself \[Zebedee Coltrin\]. Next  morning at New  Portage, he noticed that Joseph seemed to have a far off  look in his  eyes, or was looking at a distance and presently he, Joseph,  stepped  between Brothers Cowdery and Coltrin and taking them by the  arm, said,  ‚ÄòLet's take a walk.‚Äô They went to a place where there was  some  beautiful grass and grapevines and swampbeech interlaced. President   Joseph Smith then said, ‚ÄòLet us pray.‚Äô They all three prayed in   turn--Joseph, Oliver, and Zebedee. Brother Joseph then said, ‚ÄòNow   brethren, we will see some visions.‚Äô Joseph lay down on the ground on   his back and stretched out his arms and the two brethren lay on them.   The heavens gradually opened, and they saw a golden throne, on a   circular foundation, something like a light house, and on the throne   were two aged personages, having white hair, and clothed in white   garments. They were the two most beautiful and perfect specimens of   mankind he ever saw. Joseph said, ‚ÄòThey are our first parents, Adam and   Eve.‚Äô Adam was a large, broad-shouldered man, and Eve as a woman, was  as  large in proportion.‚Äù  
When in early October 1883 President John  Taylor again organized the  School of the Prophets again, Zebedee was  invited to speak to Church  Leaders, and relate these and other  experiences.lMinutes, Salt Lake City  School of the Prophets, October  11, 1883.

Zebedee would come west  in the first group of saints with Brigham Young.  Because of his  extensive  knowledge of the temples, he was asked to  help in the  dedication of the Logan Temple, and was asked to give the  benediction  at it's dedication.

On 31 May  1873, in a meeting presided over  by President Brigham Young,  then-apostle John Taylor ordained Coltrin to  be a church patriarch, a  position he held for fourteen years until his  death in Spanish Fork at  the age of 82. In that solemn ecclesiastical  capacity, he traveled  widely and pronounced more that one thousand  patriarchal blessings upon  the heads of the Latter Day Saints.

Now,  on a trip to Logan Utah, staying at the home of Bishop Henry  Ballard.  During Zebedee's stay, it was in a patriarchal blessing that he  spoke  prophetically to the young 13-year-old Melvin (who had polished  the  Patriarch's shoes in return for stories about the Prophet Joseph   Smith). The patriarch declared to the bishop's son that he would one day   sit in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles(confirming Margaret McNeil   Ballard‚Äôs never spoken revelation).

Not  only that, but take a look at this.  Shortly after Melvin's call to the  apostleship, while at a  post-Conference banquet, then-apostle George  Albert Smith entertained  Elder Ballard at his home and commented on the  startling coincidence  that when he, too, was thirteen years of age,  Zebedee Coltrin had  likewise declared in a recorded patriarchal  blessing that George Albert  Smith himself would serve as an apostle of  the Lord Jesus Christ  (Stephens, 1974, pp. 84-85; indeed, George Albert  Smith went on to serve  as Prophet-President of the Church, rising  higher in church leadership  than both his father John Henry Smith, and  grandfather George A. Smith,  who both had served as Counselors in the  First Presidency; see also  Truman G. Madsen, The Presidents of the  Church, Deseret Book, 2004)

After  Zebedee's passing, his body was buried in the Spanish Fork  Cemetery,  just five miles from where I was born. Amazing information.

241,latterdaysaints,"TL;DR I‚Äôm EQ President in my ward, have a pornography addiction, and can‚Äôt decide if I should confess to my bishop. The social pressure I would seemingly face within my ward, from my family, and the disservice to my bishopric are holdups for me. (Before commenting right away, I‚Äôd hope that you‚Äôll read my explanation)

I‚Äôve been EQ President in my ward for about 4-5 months now, but of course, I have this ‚Äúball and chain‚Äù (pornography addiction) that I know is preventing me from reaching my potential in many aspects of my life. Plus, with such an important calling and the fact that I hold priesthood keys, I feel that it‚Äôs dishonest to those I serve, my bishopric and stake presidency, and the Lord, for me to hold this calling while at the same time having unresolved transgressions. I probably shouldn‚Äôt have the calling in the first place because I should have confessed during the interview processes, but I had the following fears and holdbacks: 1) it‚Äôs a small ward with not many priesthood holders, so I didn‚Äôt want to make it difficult on the bishopric to set up a new presidency because there‚Äôs not many to choose from, 2) one character weakness I have is that I worry too much about what people think, and this is definitely true about this situation. What would my ward members, counselors (one of whom is a coworker of mine), etc think of me for all of a sudden getting released as the EQ President? 3) I have a sibling getting married in the temple in the near future (first temple wedding in both immediate family and extended family for a long time), and I‚Äôd like to attend the wedding, but I‚Äôm afraid that if I confess I‚Äôll lose my recommend and not be able to attend (thereby creating pressure from family members and me worrying what family members would think of me not attending the wedding).

252,latterdaysaints,"I give it a B+ overall.   I think it's not bad.   But as always, there's a few things to comment on, some of them more important than others.   Spoilers ahead if that might matter to you:

1)  It's supposed to be a ""historian's"" podcast but it's clearly aimed at the believing member.  This is a difficult line to straddle, IMO.  I am a believing member, but I love discussing the occasional controversy because I believe there's usually more to be learned (and that the church history and doctrine can withstand such scrutiny in most cases).  This podcast does none of that.   Call it a ""historian lite"" with a primary evangelical focus.   That said, I've learned several details that I did not know and were interesting.

2) As such, they seem leave out a discussion of Willard Bean in the episode about how the church acquired the historic lands.  What a great, missed opportunity.

3) They engage in a MAJOR pet peeve I have about podcasts.  Someone created theme music and then they use it incessantly. Every. Scene. Change.  It is a mark of rank amateurs.  It begins to be as annoying as the Window XP startup sound by the third episode.   Have a modicum of production values pleasssssse.   Just hire someone who knows how to mix music and sound.  The difference would be far more subtle and dramatic than the creators seem to realize, even spiritual.

4) My own very minor pet peeve:  my ideal length for a podcast is an hour.  In any case, the length from episode to episode varies dramatically.   That can be distracting.  It's a minor quibble, so if any of you reply with ""#4 is a minor quibble"", note that I noted that.

5) IMO, I think they should read more from the written accounts.  They quote from them, but just read them.

6) My understanding is that the Smith's had a place in the woods where they family would sometimes gather for prayer.  That is absent.  Is this not true or did they leave it out?

7) They fail to name the Methodist preacher Joseph spoke to.  I thought we knew who that probably was.  Not George Lane, but I though we knew.   William Smith's account appears to be ignored due to this error.

8) No reference that I recall, to Joseph Smith Srs. visions discussed by Lucy Mack.  I think these are fascinating.   

For the record, I do very much like the 2016 video depiction that they reference and draw from.     Do more of that please.     Think about doing Moroni's visits in that fashion.

253,latterdaysaints," *""all the feeling of a tender parent""* (1 Nephi 8:37) and ""Honour thy father and thy mother"".

As I get older and my love for my children grows, these verses from 1 Nephi 8 and Exodus 20 resonate for me more and more.  And I understand better and better why God built into parents the desire to share, exhort, and teach.  It's a divine model.  As we listen to our Father in Heaven and trust in Him, we see that his work is to bring us joy, immortality, and eternal life.  The goal of loving parents on earth (like Lehi) is the same:

\- **1 Nephi 8:37** \-- Lehi ""did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words""

\- **Exodus 20:12** \-- ""Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.""

And we can trust our omniscient Father:

\- **1 Nephi 9:6** \-- ""the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words.""","""all the feeling of a tender parent"" (Come, Follow Me)"

&gt;**Surgical Sterilization (Including Vasectomy)**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Church strongly discourages surgical sterilization as an elective form of birth control. Surgical sterilization should be considered only if (1) medical conditions seriously jeopardize life or health or (2) birth defects or serious trauma have rendered a person mentally incompetent and not responsible for his or her actions. Such conditions must be determined by competent medical judgment and in accordance with law. Even then, the persons responsible for this decision should consult with each other and with their bishop and should receive divine confirmation of their decision through prayer.

I stumbled upon this while studying a different gospel principle. I'm curious: how many of you knew about this? When/how did you find out? What have you learned about the reason for it? My best guess is that it dishonors the gift of the body in a way that other birth control methods don't; all I've got so far are guesses.

For me, I didn't come across anything against sterilization when I was studying the Church's resources for individuals on topics of sexual intimacy in marriage and [birth control](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/birth-control?lang=eng). My husband and I don't have the financial and emotional resources to care for more than our two children, and that's extremely unlikely to change during the remainder of my fertile years. We weighed sterilization pragmatically alongside other birth control options, and, as we didn't know there was any prohibition on it, tubal ligation seemed like the best choice for us.

So... what should we do next? I'm thinking I'll research more about what Church sources say about sterilization, now that I know it's a thing that's disapproved in a way that other birth control isn't. (I welcome suggestions for sources, if anyone here happens to know some.) Then I suppose we'll talk to our bishop, see what needs to happen to my temple recommend and membership status, and whether there's anything else I should do? Reversing the procedure isn't really viable at this point, nor do I think it would serve much purpose, honestly.

I guess what's bothering me most right now is that I don't feel as guilty about all this as I think I should feel for violating authoritative Church counsel. We really were prayerfully trying to do what's best for our marriage and family according to the principles that we knew at the time. I don't know.

256,latterdaysaints,"I'm sure a lot of you probably have already seen it, but if you haven't yet, I would recommend that you get a Netflix account (or an NBC mobile app subscription) and watch The Good Place. It's a show about 4 people who find out they have died and gone to the afterlife. Where you go in the afterlife is determined by a point value assigned by a team of immortal accountants watching everything on earth good and bad.  


Over time, some very interesting things that parallel gospel truths start  to emerge in the show (possible spoilers ahead):  


\-The idea that having a positive or negative point value assigned to every action that determines your fate is absolutely ludicrous and is no way to get into heaven.

\-There needs to be a third ""medium place"" for people who lived ""medium lives.""

\-People can in fact change and redeem themselves - even after death.

\-Life is complicated and it is impossible to be perfect in mortality.

\-Lots of very quick lessons about ethics and what it means to be a good person.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously it's not 100% doctrinally correct, but the fact that a show made by non-LDS writers was able to seriously think about the afterlife and come up with some really close parallels is pretty dang awesome if you ask me.

257,latterdaysaints,"I was just looking at another post, where someone else was saying they're dissatisfied with the way their Young Men's leaders run the program, and it made me think that I should make my own post about my thoughts here.

I'm now a YSA, and I've been out of the Young Men's program for a good 6 months now.  But let me say this... For the most part, my experience in Young Men's was absolutely terrible.  And I know that not all of this can be attributed to my leaders (I moved twice within my time as a Young Man), but I still feel like it's important to point out why my experience was so bad, so that hopefully it can benefit others.

One of my biggest complaints is that I did not feel respected by anyone in my Quorum, including the leaders.  I was the homeschooled, theatre-obsessed kid, which already set me apart from the crowd.  Many of the other Young Men in my ward (and the leaders themselves) were very much into sports, which is a hobby I have rarely (if ever) engaged in.  We frequently had sports-related activities (whether they were actually playing sports, watching games on TV, or attending the local High School games), and I always felt left out at said activities.  I think some of my leaders understood this, but never acted on it to make my experience better (for instance, advocating for activities I would have enjoyed more).  By the time I had my driver's license, and was responsible for getting myself to activities, I all but stopped attending Mutual.  I was not having a good experience, and so I opted to do other things instead.  My parents understand how difficult my church life was at that point, and have even congratulated me on remaining active and continuing to attend on Sundays, because they know most people at that point would just decide Church wasn't worth it and become inactive.

But I am a firm believer that one does not have a right to complain unless they also have a solution to their problem.  For me, my solution was simply graduating High School, moving off to college, and joining a YSA ward.  But this isn't exactly a possible solution for the vast majority of Young Men.  To Young Men, if you find yourself in a situation where your church experience (particularly your Young Men's experience) is basically a living Outer Darkness, address your Young Men's leaders and hopefully they will listen to you and find ways to make it more enjoyable.  Your bishop is also a good source.  To Leaders, if you can tell one of your Young Men is having a difficult experience in church, please address it.  If you need to, speak to said child's parents.  

Church is meant to be a place where everyone feels welcome, no matter their interests, race, sex, or otherwise.  I did not feel welcome in my home ward, and I do not want anyone else to feel that way.  Teenage years are bad enough as they are.

In Nephi‚Äôs day the curse of the Lamanites was that they were ‚Äúcut off from [the Lord‚Äôs] presence ‚Ä¶ because of their iniquity‚Äù (2 Nephi 5:20‚Äì21). This meant the Spirit of the Lord was withdrawn from their lives. When Lamanites later embraced the gospel of Jesus Christ, ‚Äúthe curse of God did no more follow them‚Äù (Alma 23:18). 

**The Book of Mormon also states that a mark of dark skin came upon the Lamanites after the Nephites separated from them. The nature and appearance of this mark are not fully understood.** (emphasis added) The mark initially distinguished the Lamanites from the Nephites. Later, as both the Nephites and Lamanites each went through periods of wickedness and righteousness, the mark became irrelevant as an indicator of the Lamanites‚Äô standing before God. 

**Prophets affirm in our day that dark skin is not a sign of divine disfavor or cursing.** (emphasis added) The Church embraces Nephi‚Äôs teaching that the Lord ‚Äúdenieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female‚Äù (2 Nephi 26:33).

282,latterdaysaints," Elder James Leech, who lived in Salt Lake City, relates the following  incident in his experience on first meeting with the Prophet Joseph:  
 

I was born on the 2nd of May, 1815, at Pilling Lane, Lancashire, England. About  the year 1827, my parents, with their family, moved to Preston. In the  year 1835 I remember waking in the night and hearing my mother, who was a  very religious and good woman, relating a dream or vision she had just  had to my father. In this dream it had been shown to her that the gospel  was going to come to the earth again as it was in the days of our  Savior.  
 

In 1837 the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it  was taught anciently, came to old England, and was first heralded in  Preston by President Heber C. Kimball, Brothers Joseph Fielding, Orson  Hyde and Willard Richards. My mother's dream was fulfilled to her  satisfaction, and she was one of the first to embrace the gospel. My three sisters joined soon after, but my father did not do so for some time.  
 

In the year 1841 Henry Nightingale, my sister's husband, began to  prepare to gather with the Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois. My sister asked  me if I would like to go with them. I said I would, but did not think I  was worthy to be baptized, as I was up to the time of my hearing the  gospel what people called an infidel. As my parents were willing, I came  to America with them. We sailed in the early part of May, 1841.  
 

After arriving in Nauvoo we were five or six weeks looking for  employment, but failed to get any. One morning I said to my brother-  in-law, ""Let us go and see the Prophet. I feel that he will give us  something to do."" He considered a short time, then consented to go. On  arriving at his house we inquired for the Prophet. We were told he was  over the road. So we went over, and found him in a little store selling a  lady some goods. This was the first time I had had an opportunity to be  near him and get a good look at him. I felt there was a superior spirit  in him. He was different to anyone I had ever met before; and I said in  my heart, he is truly a Prophet of the most high God.  
 

As I was not a member of the Church I wanted Henry to ask him for work,  but he did not do so, so I had to. I said, ""Mr. Smith, if you please,  have you any employment you could give us both, so we can get some  provisions?""  
 

He viewed us with a cheerful countenance, and with such a feeling of kindness said, ""Well, boys, what can you do?""  
 

We told him what our employment was before we left our native land.  
 

Said he, ""Can you make a ditch?""  
 

I replied we would do the best we could at it.  
 

""That's right, boys,"" and picking up a tape line he said, ""Come along with me.""  
 

He took us a few rods from the store, gave me the ring to hold, and  stretched all the tape from the reel and marked a line for us to work  by.  
 

""Now, boys,"" said he, ""can you make a ditch three feet wide and two and a half feet deep along this line?""  
 

We said we would do our best, and he left us. We went to work, and when it was finished I went and told him it was done.  
 

He came and looked at it and said, ""Boys, if I had done it myself it could not have been done better. Now come with me.""  
 

He led the way back to his store, and told us to pick the best ham or  piece of pork for ourselves. Being rather bashful, I said we would  rather he would give us some. So he picked two of the largest and best  pieces of meat and a sack of flour for each of us, and asked us if that  would do. We told him we would be willing to do more work for it, but he  said, ""If you are satisfied, boys, I am.""  
 

We thanked him kindly, and went on our way home rejoicing in the kindheartedness of the Prophet of our God.  
 

In November of the same year I was baptized into the Church, and from  that time until the martyrdom of our Prophet, I often had the privilege  of seeing his noble face lit up by the Spirit and power of God, as he  taught the Saints the principles of eternal life.

283,latterdaysaints,"How do I side-by-side believe that if children are sealed to parents they will not be lost in the long run with the doctrine that our own actions and repentance determine where we end up eternally? I have a son who has rejected the gospel and so many people try to reassure me that parents are promised they will not lose a child if they pray for them, don‚Äôt give up hope, etc. It seems that these two ideas contradict each other. If all it takes is to ensure eternal life is to be sealed to your parents, why do individual choices and actions matter? If my son never chooses to repent, believe in and follow God, I don‚Äôt see how or why my actions of being sealed to my spouse and him being born in the covenant can override what he does with his personal agency‚Äîthat would be like forcing him to heaven. I know the promise says they must suffer and repent, etc. but what if they truly don‚Äôt want to? What about agency? 

The referenced quote:

‚ÄúThe Prophet Joseph Smith declaredÔªø‚Äîand he never taught a more comforting doctrineÔªø‚Äîthat the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander, the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgiving father‚Äôs heart and home, the painful experience will not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God‚Äù (Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 110).",Agency vs. Promise to Parents
284,latterdaysaints,"We humans, as a species, hate to acknowledge gaps in our knowledge.  One example --our brains are literally wired to fill in the blind spots in our visual fields at all times rather than allow us to constantly see black dots in our peripheral vision.

The same can be said for scientific investigations. We collect all the data we can, and then really smart people use the best tools and methods available to make educated guesses about what life was like for these ancient civilizations...and yet they certainly get stuff completely wrong and leave out far more than they could ever include. Not because they are corrupt or biased or incompetent, just because the record has gaps in it, sometimes huge gaps.

The reason why is that the vast majority of what these cultures left behind hasn't been formally studied (or even dug up) yet. Other things were looted centuries ago. Much of human behavior doesn't leave an archaeological trace. Other traces of human activity were overwritten by later humans.

Consider this comparison:

Suppose a researcher 1000 years from now tried to learn about what life was like for humans living today in Pennsylvania by digging in a landfill containing the garbage of residents of a mid-sized city, along with a study of the remains of buildings and billboards of the city.  

Imagine if someone else came forth with the diary of an Amish farmer and claimed that man lived at the same time and place.

Would you be surprised if they concluded it is unreasonable to believe that a German-speaking population of agrarian pacifists co-existed with typical modern-day Americans?  I wouldn't be surprised at all.

If someone tells me they have a hard time believing in the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon due to a lack of archaeological evidence, I respond by inviting them to consider what an archaeologist should expect to learn about the life of Amish farmers by digging residential trash pits.

This is what I believe is the best analogy for how science approaches their investigation and why it won't ever sync up neatly with the claims of the Book of Mormon. 

In my opinion, the Nephites:

* were a small (though often-times elite and highly educated) subset of Mayan culture. 
* lived a very unique lifestyle, with something like a long-sleeved temple garment or robe (think Joseph in Egypt's coat of many colors), so they would have been very easy to spot.
* spoke the common languages of the local but also wrote in and likely spoke in an adapted version of near Eastern languages (Hebrew/Egyptian).
* were eventually hunted down and exterminated, likely with their important artifacts and buildings overrun and/or destroyed. (Consider how easy it would have been to identify a practicing Nephite if the locals wore very little clothing.)

When you factor in that Nephite culture was totally destroyed 1000 years before Europeans entered the scene and 1400-1500 years before any formal effort was made to collect, study, and protect artifacts, it isn't hard to see why I am not holding my breath that Nephite archaeological evidence will be discovered in large quantities all over Mesoamerica.

Plus, the Amish have horses, just like the Nephites did! :)",Comparing the Book of Mormon to an Amish farmer's diary...

He was told by his friends a year older that their first activity would be teaching the new deacons how to pass the sacrament, a practice session. Ok, makes sense. The youth planned to demonstrate this, with the deacon class president in charge. The adults took over right from the start. Bishop spent an hour talking to the boys and having them practice. It was not at all youth led, when clearly these YM know how to pass the sacrament because they do it every week, so why couldn't they teach the new YM with adult supervision rather than take over?

The planning meeting they had was also adult driven. They brainstormed ideas on each category. Then the adults insisted that half of the activities needed to be from the spiritual category. Not 1/4...half. 

So the YM now have activities that are literally ""memorize scriptures"" and ""YM family home evening"" and ""general conference prep"" and ""general conference review"" ""memorize articles of faith"" ""memorize new YM theme"" and that's just in the first 4 months of this year!

Your voice, set forth in revelation, and more information on the Church.  ""A Key That Will Never Rust"": The Majority of the Church Will Never Be Led Astray.  
 The Doctrine and Covenants teaches that the Church is the governed by  the Law of Common Consent (D&amp;C 20:65; 26:2; 28:13; 38:34; 41:9;  51:4; 124:144). This is a principle which is not always fully  appreciated by members of the Church today, but remains an important  safeguard given by the Lord in his revelations against deception and  imposition by evil and aspiring individuals in the last days. On several  occasions the Lord had to remind early Church members of this principle  as in the episode with Hiram Page in New York (D&amp;C 28:1-16) and a  woman  in Kirtland Ohio(D&amp;C 43:1-7).  
 

This principle also is practiced in the government of priesthood quorums as set forth in one revelation on priesthood:  
 

And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the  unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must  be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same  power or validity one with the other‚Äìa majority may form a quorum when  circumstances render it impossible to be otherwise‚ÄìUnless this be the  case, their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings which the  decisions of a quorum of three presidents were anciently, who were  ordained after the order of Melchizedek, and were righteous and holy men  (D&amp;C 107:27-29)  
 

So in addition to the general membership of the Church, the decisions of  quorums (The First Presidency, the twelve and the Seventy are  specifically mentioned) are to be preferably unanimous, but certainty by  no less than a majority of members in each respective quorum to be  considered valid.  
 

‚ÄúAnd in case that any decision of these quorums is made in  unrighteousness, it may be brought before a general assembly of the  several quorums, which constitute the spiritual authorities of the  Church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their decision (D&amp;C  107:32).  
 

And in such a case the same principles would apply.  
 

This principle outlined in section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants can  also be found in another revelation given to Joseph Smith on January  12, 1838, in Kirtland, Ohio among the records of the Church. This  revelation, while not a part of the standard works today, provides good  historical evidence for this principle of common consent as well:  
 

Thus saith the Lord, Let the first Presidency of my Church, be held in  full fellowship in Zion and all her stakes, until they shall be found  transgressors, by such an high Council as is named in the above alluded  section, in Zion, by three witnesses standing against each member of  said Presidency, and these witnesses shall be of long and faithful  standing, and such also as cannot \[p. 51\] be impeached by other  witnesses before such Council, and when a decision is had by such an  Council in Zion, it shall only be for Zion, it shall not answer for her  stakes, but if such a decision be acknowledged by the Council of her  stakes, then it shall answer for her stakes, But if it is not  acknowledged by the stakes, then such stake may have the privilege of  hearing for themselves or if such decision shall be acknowledged by a  majority of the stakes, then it shall answer for all her stakes  
 

And again, The presidency of my Church, may be tried by the voice of the  whole body of the Church in Zion, and the voice of a majority of all  her stakes  
 

And again Except a majority is had by the voice of the Church of Zion  and a majority of all her stakes, The Charges will be considered not  sustained and in order to sustain such Charge or Charges, before such  Church of Zion or her stakes, such witnesses must be had as is named  above, that is the witnesses to each President, who are of long and  faithful standing, that cannot be impeached by other witnesses before  the Church of Zion, or her stakes, And all this saith the Lord because  of wicked and aspiring men, Let all your doings be in meekness and in  humility before me even so Amen.  
 

\[Revelation given in the presence of J. Smith Jr., S. Rigdon, Vinson  Knight and Geo. W. Robinson, 12 January, 1838 at the French farm in  Kirtland, Geauga County, Ohio, in Dean C. Jesse, Ronald K. Esplin and  Richard Lyman Bushman, eds., The Joseph Smith Papers: Journals (Salt  Lake City: Church Historians Press, 2008) 1:282-83. Emphasis added. I  have slightly corrected spelling\].  
 

Here again we see the principle of common consent applied to a potential  trial of Church leaders in Zion (Missouri) or in the stakes of Zion  wherever they may be. In either case a majority votes is required to  sustain the charge were such an event to occur.  
 

In addition to the above, it appears that this principle of the Church  being governed by the law of common consent, which required at least a  majority vote was taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith and was remembered  by many of the early Saints who heard him do so (The emphasis in each of  these references in mine).  
 

Orson Hyde  
 

Joseph Smith said, some know that this work is of God, and some may not  know, but if they believe the testimony of those who do know and follow  on they will go into the Celestial kingdom. He also said, always follow  the majority of the church, for they will never go wrong. It is not by  reason and philosophy, which are after the world, that will regulate His  church, but God will regulate it by the power of the Holy Ghost through  his representative on the earth. If any people on the earth have reason  to be faithful to god in all things it is the people of the Latter-day  Saints, who have in their midst His living oracles (Orson Hyde, 11  September, 1867, in Deseret News, 25 September, 1867. Emphasis added).  
 

\[It\] reminds me of the words of Joseph the Prophet, when he said,  ‚ÄúBrethren, remember that the majority of this people will never go  astray; and as long as you keep with the majority you are sure to enter  the celestial kingdom‚Äù (Orson Hyde, 5 May 1870, JD 13:367. Emphasis  added).  
 

Edward Stevenson  
 

The writer \[Edward Stevenson\] heard the Prophet say on the stand at the  east end of the Nauvoo Temple, that the time was coming, when there  would be many dissensions from the Church. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI now see  the time which I have long desired to see. Let me go where I may, the  Gospel tree is planted never more to be rooted up, for there are those  present who are prepared to carry on the Gospel, whatever may become of  me.‚Äù He also said: ‚ÄúI will give you a key by which you may never be  deceived, if you will observe these facts: Where the true church is,  there will also be a majority of the saints, and the records and history  of the Church also‚Äù (Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, Infancy of the  Church, \[1889\], 5).  
 

Ezra T. Clark  
 

I heard the Prophet Joseph say he would give the Saints a key whereby  they would never be led away or deceived, and that was: the Lord would  never suffer the majority of this people to be led away or deceived by  impostors, nor would he allow the records of this church to fall into  the hands of the enemy (Ezra T. Clark, I.E. 5 \[January 1902\]: 202).  
 

William G. Nelson  
 

I will give you a key that will never rust. If you will stay with the  majority of the twelve apostles, and the records of the church, you will  never be led astray (William G. Nelson recollection, YWJ 17 \[December  1906\]: 543).  
 My brother William and I were baptized into the Church by the Prophet  Joseph during the summer of 1842. I well remember many of the sayings of  the Prophet which are on record in the Church. But one I will mention  here. He said: ‚ÄúI will give you a key that will never rust; if you will  stay with the majority of the twelve Apostles, and the records of the  Church, you will never be led astray (‚ÄúWilliam Goforth Nelson,‚Äù Mormon  Biography File Church Archives, Salt Lake City, Utah).  
 

Lyman O. Littlefield  
 

Once in Nauvoo I heard the Prophet declare to the people how they might  always know where to find the true Church. He gave it as a guide for  them ever afterwards, and said they day would come when they would need  it. He said: ‚ÄúFactions and parties will arise out of this Church, and  apostates will lead away many. But in the midst of all this, keep with  the majority, for the true leaders of God‚Äôs people will always be able  to have a majority, and the records of the Church will be with them.  Keep with the majority, for where the carcass is, there will the eagles  be gathered together‚Äù (Lyman O. Littlefield, Millennial Star 45/25 \[18  June, 1883\]: 389. Emphasis added).  
 

Mosiah Hancock  
 

Brother Joseph gave us to understand that it was our duty to follow the  Twelve. The majority of this people will be right; but when you see  people thirsting for the blood of the Saints, you may know they are not  right (Autobiography of Mosiah Hancock, 28. Emphasis added).  
 

Brigham Young  
 

Among a great many other things he said, and he had a foreboding that he  would be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. ‚ÄúI will give you a key  to govern your actions if I should be slain by my enemies. If ever this  transpires, some persons will stand forth who honor and hold the keys  of the holy priesthood, and the main body of the people will follow that  individual. You may depend upon this.‚Äù many of your are witnesses with  regard to the truth of this saying (Brigham Young Address, 7 October  1863, HDC, Ms d 1234 Box 49, folder11. Emphasis added).   
 

Joseph Smith said that where the keys of the Kingdom were, there would  be the place to gather. Wherever the Twelve and Council are, there will  the keys be, and the place of gathering (Brigham Young, 3 May, 1846,  Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 149-52)  
 

W. W. Phelps  
 

‚ÄúIt takes a majority of any quorum, according to the order of God, as  declared in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, which I hold in my hand, and  the common consent of the whole church, to make any act valid; every  ordination, therefore made by Sidney Rigdon, he being one only out of a  quorum of three, even if he had not otherwise transgressed is illegal‚Äù  (Trial of Sidney Rigdon, Times &amp; Seasons 5/18 \[1 October, 1844\]:  663).  
 

This principle also seems to have been known to Oliver Cowdery as  reported by additional witnesses of his public testimony when he  returned to the Church in 1848.  
 

Oliver Cowdery  
 

Brother Hyde has just said that it was all important that we keep in the  true channel in order to avoid the sand bars. This is true. The channel  is here. The priesthood is here. I was present with Joseph when a holy  angel from God came down from heaven and conferred, or restored, the  Aaronic Priesthood and said at the same time that it should remain upon  the earth while the earth stands. I was also present with Joseph when  the Melchizedek Priesthood was conferred by the holy angels of God which  we then confirmed on each other by the will and commandment of God.  This Priesthood is also to remain upon the earth until the last remnant  of time (Oliver Cowdery, Reuben Miller Journal, 21 October, 1848.  Emphasis added).  
 

Oliver Cowdery, who had just arrived from Wisconsin with his family, on  being invited, addressed the meeting. He bore testimony in the most  positive terms of the truth of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of  the priesthood to the earth, and the mission of Joseph Smith as the  prophet of the last days. And told the people if they wanted to follow  the right path, to keep in the main channel of the stream‚Äìwhere the body  of the Church goes, there is the authority; and all these lo here‚Äôs and  lo there‚Äôs, have no authority. But this people have the holy  priesthood, ‚Äúfor the angel said unto Joseph Smith, Jr., in my hearing,  that this priesthood shall remain on earth unto the end‚Äù (George A.  Smith to Orson Pratt, Council Bluffs, Iowa, 20 October 1848, MS 11  \[1849\]: 14. Emphasis added).  
 

O. Cowdery is dead. His last testimony will never be forgotten by many.  He said to his friend, \[there\] was no salvation but in the valley and  through the priesthood there (Phineas Young to Brigham Young,  Kanesville, 25 April 1850).  
 

Oliver Cowdery said to the people, when he came to Pottawotamie and  requested to be restored to the Church, ‚ÄúFollow the Twelve: they are the  men with whom the priesthood rests. If you follow the main channel of  the stream, you will go right; but if you run into a bayou, you will  find yourself among snags‚Äù (George A. Smith, 10 January 1858, JD 7:117.  Emphasis added).  
 

This Gospel is the ‚Äústone taken from the mountain without hands.‚Äù John  the Baptist, holding the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood; Peter, James,  and John, holding the keys of the Melchisedek Priesthood, have  ministered for those who shall be heirs of salvation, and with these  administrations ordained men to the same Priesthoods. These Priesthoods,  with their authority, are now, and must continue to be, in the body of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Blessed is the Elder  who received the same, and thrice blessed and holy is he who shall  endure to the end (Oliver Cowdery to Samuel W. Richards, 13 January  1849, IE 2 \[December 1898\]: 95-96. Emphasis added).  
 

Here it is important to observe that the Saints were never taught to  follow the majority of the world or the wicked, but to follow the  majority of the Twelve and the Saints. Again, this is consistent with  the other revelations in the Scriptures about the nature of the Church  in the Latter-day Days (Even the parable of the ten virgins suggests at  least half of the Saints would remain wise Matthew 25:1-13). Knowing  that Joseph Smith lived and died a true Prophet, and knowing that the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is true, entails an  understanding of where the Church stands in the Bridegroom's timeline.

315,latterdaysaints,"Hi reddit! I'm currently a senior in high school (female) and am totally conflicted on whether or not I should serve a mission and could really really use some advice. I've prayed about it a lot but I still feel very confused.

Reasons why I shouldn't: 
I have no idea when I would serve. My three options appear to be:
- before college (I turn 19 in September): I'm a convert to the Church and my dad has already said that there is no way he'll help pay for a mission. I do have about $3000 dollars of my own money saved up but I really will be needing that for college. Unless my ward will help me I don't see how I could afford to serve before college. Also being a convert to the Church I'll only have been a member for a little less than 3 years; I'm not sure I'l know the gospel well enough. I'm a very academic focused person and I'm not sure I like the idea of going into college after not being in school for two years.

- during college: I'm not to a college with a very small LDS population (OU) so a mission will not be normal. I'm quite an introverted person and am not sure I like the idea of having to make friends ""twice"". Can anyone who has served a mission who didn't go to BYU or the U comment on what this is like? I also worry that it will be difficult to go back to college after being out of school for 18 months.

- after college: my current plan is to go on to grad school after college and get my PhD. I'm worried that being out of school for two years will be seen as a negative for PhD admissions. I'll also be nearly 23 by the time I graduate, and by that point I would like to be married. Planning on serving a mission after college would basically mean not looking for a husband throughout all of college. Serving a mission would basically mean that the earliest I could meet someone is 24 1/2 meaning I won't be married till 25/26. And as someone who wants 5-8 children (and really feels like that is God's plan for me), not being married until at least 25/26 doesn't sit right, especially since the women in my family have had such a hard time getting pregnant. Again, also, I'm not sure going into an MA-PhD after being out of school for two years is a good idea. 

Like I mentioned above, the main reason I'm hesitant to serve is timing. A) when I would go and B) I'm worried I'd be getting married too late. 

The other reason I'm anxious to serve is that I have aspergers syndrome. I seriously have no idea how I would cope having to constantly be around someone for 18 months. I struggle enough constantly being around my best friends at slumber parties just for one night before I need just a bit of alone time relief.

Reasons why I should serve:
I think I'd be a great missionary and I think I'd enjoy it. I love this Church so much and have a very very strong testimony. I've always been told I'd make a great teacher (hence Why I want to become a lecturer) and everyone at my ward and the sister missionaries I know have all said they think I'd make a great missionary and that I should seriously consider serving. I absolutely love this gospel and want to share it with as many people as possible. 

At the moment what I'm considering doing is going to college and then half way through my freshman or sophomore year applying for a mission and then if I get a mission call, praying to see if it feels right. Any thoughts on this? Is it seriously looked down on if I turn down a mission call?

TL;DR I think I'd make a great missionary and would enjoy it but it just doesn't seem to fit in my life plan. Should I serve?",Should I serve a mission?!?!

318,latterdaysaints,"I have, reluctantly admitted, a lot of anxiety. To the point that if I chose to go to a doctor about it, they would probably diagnose me with some form of anxiety or panic disorder. I had a really bad episode on Saturday that took most of the day to recover from. The trigger being the fighting between my roommate and her boyfriend which resulted in smashed valuables and a police call. I only heard it and yet it resulted in a lot of the usual panic/anxiety attack symptoms from 3 am to 7 am. And then a lot of shaking and a fear of the outside for the rest of the day.

I hadn't had a major one since going to church in August, but the frequency and intensity escalate exponentially as it gets closer to my baptism.

Scenarios where my physical disability causes distress, where I encounter stimuli that mirrors past trauma, where I'm unable to leave crowded areas, or find it incredibly easy to project irrational fears are almost as often as one would eat meals in a day. Therefore, anxiety attacks are exhaustingly often.

320,latterdaysaints,"When I was a young teen, between 12-14, I lived in a place where there weren‚Äôt many members. In my school of 2500, there were 3 of us. None of my close friends were members, and one day I started swearing. It got so bad that one of my friends talked to me and said that I swore a lot. I moved away from there a year or so later to a place surrounded by members. Almost everyone around me was a member, and I stopped swearing cold turkey. I think the idea of my younger siblings/parents hearing me swear (and getting in trouble for it) kept me from swearing. I grew up, went on a mission, came home and for a couple years I had no issues. But  in the past 6 months or so I‚Äôve started to swear again. 
I work in an industry where everyone swears at everything (just not in front of the customer). Apart from that I feel like everywhere I go I am always hearing swears, and the words don‚Äôt even mean anything to me. They don‚Äôt sound bad, or make me feel bad, they‚Äôre just words that I say when I hurt myself, or am really upset, but that‚Äôs it. My husband doesn‚Äôt really care, because he‚Äôs around a lot of cussing as well, and I don‚Äôt think it means anything to him either. 
Ive tried repenting, but it‚Äôs not true repentance, because even though I try to feel bad, I don‚Äôt. I want to feel bad, but I don‚Äôt. I also have prayed for help to kick this habit, but I always slip up, and then I‚Äôm saying the exact same things in my prayers. Saying I‚Äôm sorry for swearing, and asking for help not to.

321,latterdaysaints,"Saturday afternoon I received a text to see if my wife and I would visit with a member of the stake presidency the next day at the new stake offices (I think our stake has a split coming up soon). I was nervous about what it meant. I'm not very social and really dislike being the focus of larger groups (speaking in Sacrament Meeting, conducing meetings, etc.). I also have had some various ups and downs over the last couple years and I think I still carry some painful feelings from some of that. I was worried about what I may be asked to do and if I had the faith or ability to carry out what could potentially be asked of me. I haven't ever turned down a calling and know we should always have faith to answer the call, but I really was wondering if I could do it depending on what it was. I ended Saturday night with a feeling that God knew my position and capabilities and worries and that I hopefully wouldn't be called to something above what I'm ready for. I felt like maybe a clerk position or technical specialist was what was coming my way.

Sunday morning, though, I opened the Gospel Library app and continued from where I had left off in 3 Nephi 13:

 Not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present,  necessarily constitutes doctrine. A single statement made by a single  leader on a single occasion often represents a personal, though  well-considered, opinion, but is not meant to be officially binding for  the whole Church. With divine inspiration, the First Presidency (the  prophet and his two counselors) and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles  (the second-highest governing body of the Church) counsel together to  establish doctrine that is consistently proclaimed in official Church  publications. This doctrine resides in the four ‚Äústandard works‚Äù of  scripture (the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and  Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price), official declarations and  proclamations, and the Articles of Faith. (""Approaching Mormon  Doctrine,"" LDS Newsroom, 4 May 2007)  
 

Joseph Smith (President)  
  \[A journal entry\]  
 This morning I ... visited with a brother and sister from Michigan, who  thought that ""a prophet is always a prophet;"" but I told them that a  prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such. (History of the  Church, 5:265; see also Teachings, p. 278)  
 

Recollection of Jesse W. Crosby: Brother Crosby said that he with  some other brethren once went to the Prophet and asked him to give them  his opinion on a certain public question. Their request was refused.  \[Joseph\] told them he did not enjoy the right vouchsafed to every  American citizen; that of free speech. He said to them that when he  ventured to give his private opinion on any subject of importance his  words were often garbled and their meaning twisted and then given out as  the word of the Lord because they came from him. (""LaFayette C. Lee,  Notebook,"" LDS Church Archives, Salt Lake City, Utah; also in  Remembering Joseph)  
 

D. Todd Christofferson (Quorum of the Twelve)  
 

\[N\]ot every statement made by a Church leader, past or present,  necessarily constitutes doctrine. It is commonly understood in the  Church that a statement made by one leader on a single occasion often  represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion, not meant to be  official or binding for the whole Church. (""The Doctrine of Christ,""  Ensign, May 2012)  
 

Bruce R. McConkie (Quorum of the Twelve)  
 

Are all prophetic utterances true? Of course they are! This is what  the Lord‚Äôs system of teaching is all about. Anything which his servants  say when moved upon by the Holy Ghost is scripture.... But every word  that a man who is a prophet speaks is not a prophetic utterance. Joseph  Smith taught that a prophet is not always a prophet, only when he is  acting as such. Men who wear the prophetic mantle are still men; they  have their own views; and their understanding of gospel truths is  dependent upon the study and inspiration that is theirs. (""Finding  Answers to Gospel Questions,"" Letter dated 1 July 1980. Published in  Teaching Seminary Preservice Readings, Religion 370, 471, and 475  (2004))  
 

\[T\]he opinions and views, even of a prophet, may contain error,  unless those opinions and views were inspired by the Spirit. (‚ÄúAre the  General Authorities Human?‚Äù Address delivered at the Institute of  Religion Forum at the University of Utah, October 28, 1966)  
 

Joseph Fielding Smith (Quorum of the Twelve)  
 

That which we accept as scripture today is the utterance of prophets  who spoke by inspiration and in the spirit of prophecy in olden times.  Age has made it venerable to many because it is ancient. The word of the  Lord delivered by the power of the Holy Ghost to the servants of the  Lord today is also scripture, just as much as it was in ancient  times....  
 

However, we, the elders of Israel, do not always speak as ""moved  upon by the Holy Ghost."" There is danger that we may permit our own  inclinations and desires to influence us and we may be stubborn enough  to lack the essential humility, so that the Holy Ghost cannot break  through the shell with which we surround ourselves. Therefore, we should  seek for humility in the spirit of prayer and obedience so that we may  always be subject to the teachings of the Spirit of the Lord.

Previous to declaring a doctrine, I have always inquired in my own  mind, ""can this doctrine be proved by revelation given, or by reason, or  can it not?"" If I found it could be proved, I \[was\] for the doctrine;  but if I found there was no evidence to substantiate it, I laid it  aside; in all this, however, I may have erred, for to err is human.  (Journal of Discourses, 2:58-59)  
 

Harold B. Lee (Quorum of the Twelve)  
 

Someone has rightly said that it is not to be thought that every word spoken by our leaders is inspired....  
 

It is not to be thought that every word spoken by the General  Authorities is inspired, or that they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost  in everything they write. I don't care what his position is, if he  writes something or speaks something that goes beyond anything that you  can find in the standard Church works, unless that one be the prophet,  seer, and revelator‚Äîplease note that one exception‚Äîyou may immediately  say, ""Well, that is his own idea."" And if he says something that  contradicts what is found in the standard Church works, you may know by  that same token that it is false, regardless of the position of the man  who says it. We can know or have the assurance that they are speaking  under inspiration if we so live that we can have a witness that what  they are speaking is the word of the Lord. There is only one safety, and  that is that we shall live to have the witness to know. (Teachings of  Harold B. Lee, p. 540-541).  
 

There have been times when even the President of the Church has not  been moved upon by the Holy Ghost. There is, I suppose you‚Äôd say, a  classic story of Brigham Young in the time when Johnston‚Äôs army was on  the move. The Saints were all inflamed, and President Young had his  feelings whetted to fighting pitch. He stood up in the morning session  of general conference and preached a sermon vibrant with defiance at the  approaching army, declaring an intention to oppose them and drive them  back. In the afternoon, he rose and said that Brigham Young had been  talking in the morning but the Lord was going to talk now. He then  delivered an address in which the tempo was the exact opposite of the  morning sermon. Whether that happened or not, it illustrates a  principle: that the Lord can move upon His people but they may speak on  occasions their own opinions. (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, ed. Clyde  J. Williams (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1996), p. 542)  
 

B.H. Roberts (Presidency of the Seventy)  
 

\[The\] Lord evidently proposes that man shall act here largely upon  his own intelligence, exercise his own agency, and develop the powers,  intelligent and moral, that are within him. That is why men are here in  this earth-probation. While I believe the Lord will help me at need, I  think it is improper to assign every word and every act of theirs to an  inspiration from the Lord; for if that were true, we would have to  acknowledge ourselves as being wholly taken possession of by the Lord,  and not permitted to go to the right or to the left, but as he guided  us. Needless to say that in that event there would be no error in  judgment, no blunders made. Where would the human agency or human  intelligence exist in the one case or be developed in the other under  such circumstances? They would not exist. Hence, I think it is a  reasonable conclusion to say that constant, never-varying inspiration is  not a factor in the administration of the affairs even of the Church;  not even good men, no, not though they be prophets or other high  officials of the Church, are at all times and in all things inspired of  God. It is only occasionally and at need that God comes to their aid.  (Defense of the Faith and the Saints, \[Salt Lake City: Deseret News,  1907\] 1:527)  
 

I will add one more here on my own from Deuteronomy Chapter 18:22 When a  prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor  come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the  prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.  
 

Should anyone still feel a little bit confused? Don't be. Proverbs  
 Chapter 3:5  Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  
 

6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  
 

We live in the latter days, when me have access to more scripture, more  spirit led prophetic utterances, and even the restoration of the  priesthoods, and the fullness of access to the spirit's direction, that  comes with membership in the Lord's true restored church, (when  worthy)the blessings of the gift of the holy ghost.",Not All Statements of Church Leaders Are Considered Doctrine

343,latterdaysaints,"The age of the earth and the theory of organic evolution as given to us by the scientific community is wholly incompatible with the doctrine of the Fall. The doctrine of the Fall, as laid out in ""modern"" scripture, clearly and unambiguously declares that all created things pertaining to the earth (including man) were first created spiritually and distinctly in the premortal existence. The physical creation which then followed was likewise distinct i.e. each spirit being receiving a singular &amp; unique physical body in which they were placed. And most importantly, these physical bodies as well as the entire earth were not subject to death, decay or any of the biological processes experienced in mortality. Also, and this to is important, there was no procreation. Nor was there any time, at least in the sense that we experience it in mortality. And without death, procreation or time there could be no organic evolution or the lengthy geological processes described by science.

""\[For\] behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children . . . But behold, Adam fell that men (as well as all other created things) might be . . .

345,latterdaysaints,"I have noticed a lot of help and requests on this subreddit of people reaching out who are struggling, so as I studied Come Follow Me this week, I thought I would share an insight I had. 

In Lehi's dream, even though there were 4 groups of people, there were 2 distinct groups: those at the ""tree of life"", and those at the ""great and spacious building"". This draws a line between the two as those who participate in eternal salvation and those who choose other, worldly things therefore sacrificing eternal life. But there is a missing piece in this dream. 

Through Christ, we may all be saved, and because of Christ, those people in the great and spacious building still have the opportunity to get back to the tree of life. It might not be easy, but when we put our faith in God through prayer and scripture study, combined with the infinite atonement of Jesus Christ, he is essentially building a ""bridge"" back across the river , and asking us to please come back with him. He knows what you are going through and has felt every trial, lack of faith, pain, and suffering you have, but all he wants is the best for you. If you feel you are in the great and spacious worldly building, let Him build the bridge for you back to the tree of life.

There is a talk from Boyd K. Packer from April 2003 General Conference where he says the following: 

&gt;Once  in a stake meeting, I noticed a larger than usual number of older  members, most of them widows. I mentioned to the stake president how  impressive they were.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  president replied, ‚ÄúYes, but they are not active in the Church,‚Äù  meaning they did not serve as leaders or teachers. He spoke as though  they were a burden.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  repeated his words, ‚ÄúNot active in the Church?‚Äù and asked, ‚ÄúAre they active in the gospel?‚Äù He did not quite understand the difference at  first.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like many of us, he concentrated so much on what people *do* that he overlooked what they *are,* a priceless resource of experience, wisdom, and inspiration. 

I hope that those of you who are struggling with aspects of the church, whether it be certain opinionated members, lack of organization, etc don't lose the gospel in your life. It hurts me to see members on here struggle and reach out for help in their dark times. There is nothing wrong with returning to focus on the basic gospel doctrine and be made whole once again, there is always hope.","Lehi's Dream, the missing piece"

- Christ‚Äôs Atonement allows mankind to be saved from their sins and return to live with God and their families forever.

- Christ‚Äôs original Church as described in the New Testament has been restored in modern times.

- We have additional scripture, the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, that involves a group of Jews that fled Israel and their descendants. Jesus is mentioned an average of every 1.7 verses in the Book of Mormon by 100~ different names ('Christ' alone is used something like 400 times).

365,latterdaysaints,"So a little about me, I'm a single guy, born and raised in the church, went on a mission and I go to a YSA ward. I've had the same kind of problem my whole life, which is that I've never felt like I belong in the church, socially anyway. I'm an active member and I believe in the restored gospel, but I've always felt out of place at church, especially in YSA wards. 

Growing up I was always the outcast in my deacon/teacher/priest's quorum. The other guys went to another school and we had different interests, so I was never invited to hang out with them outside of church. Eventually they started to pick on me, so after a while of that I wanted to stop going altogether. On my mission it was a little better because I was there with a purpose, to teach the gospel and support the church, but even then I always had the feeling that the members of the wards I served in liked my companions more than me simply because I'm very introverted and not as socially adept. And when I got home and began going to YSA wards again, it literally felt like going back to high school. All the attractive, outgoing people were the popular kids who all hung out together and had their clique. The times I tried getting to know people ended up being one time awkward conversations that ended with me going home and banging my head against the wall because I dont know how to connect with people. So I ended up sitting in the back by myself, not talking to anyone because I felt like I wasn't worth talking to. Don't even get me started on dating because that's largely been a disaster for me.

I'm 24 now, and almost all my friends that I did have have gotten married and moved on, while I'm still where I've always been, spending my time at church trying to be contemplative and connecting with my Father in Heaven, which is better some days than others, but largely, I spend my time at church alone. I try to tell myself that I don't go to church to socialize, I go to renew my covenants and spend time with God. While that is true, theres still that undeniable human need to connect with other people, and even further find an eternal companion one day, but I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be able to do that. And that is starting to negatively effect my relationship with God, probably because I'm starting to project my perceived relationships with other people onto Him.

Now, I've never been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, mostly because I've never had the opportunity to. But I wouldn't be surprised if I was diagnosed with some form of depression and/or social anxiety, as I've felt this way my whole life and it also runs in my family to some degree. 

Lately I've been struggling to get myself to go to church, and it doesn't matter what ward I go to because they all feel the same to me. I see all these people connecting with each other and I just can't reach that same point. I feel like I don't belong. I've gone months without a calling, not really sure why. I've never met the people who I'm supposed to minister to, not the people who are supposed to minister to me. I can't shake the feeling that if I just stopped going that no one would miss me. Every week I go to church and I see those same outgoing, attractive people doing what they do, and I feel even more isolated. I'm frustrated because I feel trapped, like I can't do anything about it. And to be frank, some days I've even resented those people for being able to do what I can't.

I feel like I'm missing out on the full experience, not just in church but life in general. I don't feel like I can serve God the way I am now. I would be interested in hearing the experiences of other members of the church who are introverted or suffer from social anxiety or depression, because at the very least it would be nice to hear that I'm not the only one who feels this way. Or any advice on what I can do would be appreciated.

404,latterdaysaints,"I'm interested in hearing how others who experience Depression and/or Social Anxiety have found success fitting into the Church.

About me: born/raised in the church, served a mission (i'm a guy), currently active, single in a YSA ward. I was diagnosed with Depression and Social Anxiety a few months ago. I am seeing a therapist, though I'm not really feeling like things are getting any better.

I've always considered myself to be extremely introverted. For a long time, I've felt like the Church is extremely hostile towards people who just want to be alone and don't have an interest in socializing or making friends. In one ward our leadership scolded us for not coming to ward activities, because we weren't putting on an inviting face for investigators or less-actives who might be there. It's not just at a local level -- the entire concept behind ministering (as I understand it, anyway) is reaching out to those around you and being friendly. Telling somebody with Social Anxiety to do that feels like as much of a slap in the face as asking somebody in a wheelchair to get involved with Elder's Quorum basketball nights. Even scripturally, we're told to 'mourn with those that mourn' and 'comfort those that stand in need of comfort'. On the very very rare occasions that I've been in a position to try that, I've only made the situation a thousand times worse due to my inability to properly empathize with people (related to depression) and caused myself to go into my own depressive episode because of my failure. There's also the rather obvious bit about marriage that us YSAs hear plenty about. I'm actually in a relationship now, but it's not at all clear to me how I can fit another person into my life for the rest of eternity when I just want to be alone most of the time. Quite frankly, the idea of coming home from a tiring and probably stressful (on average, anyway) day of work, and having to give my attention to another person, every single day, for the rest of my life, is absolutely terrifying.

I'm having a very hard time understanding how I can thrive as a member of the church while suffering from Social Anxiety. In a strange way, I actually feel like I understand a bit better how it might feel to be a gay member of the church -- we both, by our very nature, have inclinations that are directly opposed to what the Church teaches us we should be.

I'm especially interested in hearing from other members of the church who experience Social Anxiety about how you've managed to be at peace as a member of Christ's church. I'm also happy to hear thoughts from anybody else who feels like they might have something to add.

414,latterdaysaints,"Hello,

I'm telling my sister missionaries tonight that I am going to get baptized. I have been through many groups of sisters because I had to learn to ""feel"" religion. I was raised in a family that HATES religion with a passion. Going to church and getting baptized will mean probably years of teasing from them. However I married an LDS man and his whole family took me in with open arms and every single one of them says they can already feel the spirit in and around me and that I already act like a member of the church. I never once considered to even try to believe in a single God or even Jesus Christ. The thought of not having my husband forever really scares me though so I agreed to the lessons to see if I can get sealed.

After many many months I have been getting signs non-stop from Scripture, friends, family, completely non-religion references that sometimes you have to show your willingness to grow and step in the unknown to really feel the blessings.

So tonight I tell the sisters I hope to get baptized on the 25th. I'm still so nervous because I haven't really had that overwhelming confirmation feeling from God but I can't ignore the signs to just do it.

423,latterdaysaints," No wonder Martin Harris has been referred to as ""the man who knew"". Yet  he and the other Book of Mormon witnesses continue to be assailed. Here  are some facts. The Book of Mormon witnesses were persecuted, families  kicked out of homes, wives raped, assets seized, and on and on. I will  be doing lot's of Book of Mormon evidence posts this next few months.  This is the beginning, I think f.f. readers will enjoy them. Please  share when you can.  
 

The three witnesses:  30 interviews or reports of contact w/ Oliver  Cowdery, minimum of 70 with David Whitmer, and about 50 with Martin  Harris.  The eight witnesses shared up to 60 reports, affirming their  experiences holding and evaluating the Gold Plates.  
 

In contrast, a very small number of records critical to the witnesses‚Äô  testimony exist (8 to 10 total).   8-10 vs. 200.   So, around 5% of the  total records relative to the witnesses argue that the witnesses made it  all up.  Anderson shows how these critics ‚Äî 1 named Stephen Burnett was  recently excommunicated and hostile to the Church ‚Äî take the witnesses‚Äô  stories out of context, misreport, and otherwise claim the witnesses  were not credible.

In a notarized statement dated 29 October 1921, George Godfrey, who  prepared Martin Harris‚Äôs grave in Clarkston, Utah, summarized his  lengthy acquaintance with the Witness.  Then he offered this interesting  statement:  
 

Prior to his death and in his last sickness I sat up nights with him  upon many an occasion, in connection with my Brothers, John E. Godfrey  and Thomas Godfrey, both of whom now reside at Clarkston, aforesaid, and  who can make affidavit to the things I am herein stating: that many  times I have heard the said Martin Harris bear witness to the  truthfulness and genuineness of the Book of Mormon, at times when he was  enjoying good health and spirits and when he was on his deathbed; that  his testimony never varied;  
 

that I have seen others and that I myself have tried to entrap him  relative to the testimony which he bore, by cros \[sic\] questioning him  relative to the scenes and events which are Church History in connection  with the bringing forth of the Book of Mormon; that upon all of these  questions his mind was clear as it is possible for the human mind to be,  and that his testimonies have left no tract \[sic\] in my mind that he  actually conversed with an angel who bore testimony to him of the  truthfulness of the records contained in the Book of Mormon; that he saw  and handled the gold plates from which the said records were taken;  
 

that a few hours before his death, and when he was so weak and enfeebled  that he was unable to recognize me or anyone, and knew not to whom he  was speaking, I asked him if he did not feel that there was an element,  at least, of fraudulence and deception in the things that were written  and told of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and he replied as he  had always done, and many, many times in my hearing, and with the same  spirit that he always manifested when enjoying health and vigor:  
 

‚ÄúThe Book of Mormon is no fake.  I know what I know.  I have seen what I  have seen, and I have heard what I have heard.  I have seen and handled  the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written.  An angel  appeared to me and others and testified to the truthfulness of the  record, and had I been willing to have perjured myself and sworn falsely  to the testimony I now bear, I could have been a rich man, but I could  not have testified other than I have done and am now doing, for these  things are true.‚Äù

425,latterdaysaints,"I am someone who is formerly atheist and very anti-religion, though I‚Äôve recently been meeting with LDS missionaries with my girlfriend and for the first time in our lives we believe we‚Äôve felt an actual presence of the Holy Spirit. I‚Äôm not sure if it is just pseudoscience or a placebo effect, but during my meetings with those individuals and even while praying by myself the past couple weeks, I‚Äôve felt so much more hope, peace, want to do good, and just general happiness for the first time in a long while due to a mental illness that I struggle with along with other issues in my life. My reason for coming to this subreddit is purely to seek some sort of guidance from you guys because I‚Äôm completely new to all of this. The missionaries even taught me how to pray a couple weeks ago which I‚Äôve been trying to do multiple times a day because I recognize that I genuinely need God and Jesus Christ in my life. 

I do have some questions though, such as:

1.) How exactly does the Holy Spirit operate? How do I know that what I‚Äôm feeling is the Holy Spirit?

2.) I‚Äôve been told by the missionaries that Joseph Smith is the first prophet since the Great Apostasy. Matthew 7:15-20 says to be weary of false prophets and that you shall know them of their fruits. Do any of you have personal testimonies of some of Joseph Smith and the other prophets‚Äô ‚Äúfruits‚Äù besides the Book of Mormon?

3.) What should I do, read, or study to move forward in my Spiritual journey? I‚Äôve been reading the Bible and the Book of Mormon a good bit, though do any of you have books, chapters, or verses that you recommend for me to read and/or start with?

4.) Is there any other proof of God and Jesus Christ besides just ‚Äòfeeling it‚Äô? I would love to hear your testimonies on how He has blessed your lives and how you know it‚Äôs truly Him.

431,latterdaysaints,"My sister left the church years ago, and her husband left just last month as well. She's been sending me lots of topics that she wants me to ""know the truth"" about. I've been strong in the church for a while now, but didn't know a lot of these things she talked about because I have a very primary knowledge of church history, but a very strong testimony of Christ. They all revolve around the Gospel Topics Essays put out by the church a few years ago. Over the last week of reading about them and talking with my husband who is so knowledgeable about Gospel doctrine and history, I'm torn. 


These were the issues she's trying to ""shed light on"", as if the church was hiding them (which I don't think is very accurate).


- Multiple accounts of the first vision
- Validity and historicity of the Book of Abraham
- The fact that horses weren't historically around during Nephi's time, but he speaks of them
- Race and the priesthood 
- The age of Joseph's multiple wives and Emma's lack of knowledge about them


Honestly, I didn't even know there were multiple accounts of the first vision. When I learned that his first account said he went to go seek forgiveness, then later changed it to ask which church to join, red sirens were going off every which way. Someone posted in this sub about a book called A Reason For Faith, and I started listening to it from the Deseret Bookshelf app. The beginning of the book, coupled with a few articles posted here, and a lot of your comments as well, really solidified my testimony of the first vision. I don't necessarily think I had a testimony to begin with, but I certainly do now. And I definitely don't think that it was a coincidence that this was something she tried twisting and getting me to leave about, after what President Nelson urged us to do recently. I don't think I would have researched it on my own, to be honest. But I digress.


The Book of Abraham I don't find any issues with. Witnesses said that often time when translating the BoM, Joseph wasn't even looking directly at the plates. So who's to say that the Book of Abraham isn't true? Among other things, I didn't find this to be an issue.


The fact that my sister is trying to throw me off by an animal really blows my mind. Unicorns are talked about in the Bible for goodness sake (I know they are referring to an ox). Maybe there wasn't a word to describe the animal they rode because there are plenty of words that don't translate across languages. ((tin foil hat theory: unicorns really did exist and died with Christ ü§£ü§£ I kid, I kid))


When it comes to the last 2 topics, I'm struggling. The book I'm reading gave me some good clarity on other things, but left me feeling worse about these 2. I am a firm believer of ""you can't judge a previous time on today's standards."" And I do have the stance of ""I don't know all the answers, but I do know I am where I need to be."" But is that enough?


Why didn't Joseph tell Emma about his plural marriages at first if this was something God commanded? This one really bothers me.


Why was the church so welcome of blacks, but then started to change their opinion, going so far to say the change was coming from the Lord? Why have the firm stance of ""men shall be punished for their own sons, but not for Adam's transgressions."" But then go and punish black people because of something that Cain did? (Which I don't even believe that is why some people have difference colored skin...but this is what the prophet was teaching.) And then when people were dissatisfied with that theory, go and say it was because they were less valiant in the premortal existence?? Again, I understand that we can't fully understand *everything* because we live in such a different time. But man, these just really got under my skin


Is it possible to believe in the church, but not believe in some of the things the fathers of the restoration did? I have such a strong testimony of the BoM. Seriously, how can people really not think that Christ visited other people on the earth? It gives me hope and brings me joy. And I know that we have a living prophet on the earth today. And the teachings of the church now and the feelings I get from the temple really keep me alive. But these 2 things I'm really scratching my head at.

435,latterdaysaints,"I am posting a few thoughts after spending some time reading through the subreddit the last few days. I hope it helps someone out there.

Heavenly Father created a grand plan to give every single person a way to return to Him. There is literally no one who can't follow it. It doesn't matter if you're a gay, straight, black, white, male, female, or only have one arm. You can follow God's plan. We all have the ability to humble ourselves and submit to His will. We can receive baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and make the same covenants in the temple to continue toward exaltation. The plan is perfect.

We, unfortunately, are not.

So Satan, on the other hand, capitalizes on that and tries to make us feel marginalized by God's plan. He tells us the plan doesn't fit us. It doesn't cover us. The plan is only for people who have heterosexual attraction. The plan is only for stay-at-home moms and working dads. The plan is only for people who don't struggle with anxiety or mental illness. The plan is only for conservatives. The plan is only for the upper and middle-class. The plan is only for people who don't struggle with pornography. The plan is only for people who _________ (fill in your problem). He whispers, ""Look around you. Everyone else is doing great, and you're struggling. Something is wrong with you. Why are you so different? Why are you the only one here who doesn't seem to get it. God isn't listening to you. He isn't answering your prayers. Why? Maybe you don't belong here. Or maybe, somehow, when God was crafting this great plan of salvation, He forgot about you. And if He forgot about you, then this whole thing isn't true.""

Pretty soon, as we listen to these whispers, we stop seeing the whole picture, and that mirror Paul talks about that we see through darkly gets darker and darker until we can't see anything but ourselves. Then instead of listening to God's inspired leaders, he gets us listening to other voices who tell us that the characteristic which made us feel marginalized is actually what defines us. So we seek out other people who share that opinion, and that thing that once made us feel small now makes us feel enlightened. We realize that we know *more* than those silly people who still go to church and follow the plan. And we surround ourselves with people who tell us exactly what we think and what we want to hear.

But the truth is that the plan covers everyone who is only willing to submit to His will. Humility is the key. Even white, straight, heterosexual Utah Mormon males have inherent qualities and desires that, if allowed free reign, will drive him away from God's plan and into spiritual darkness. Society and Satan's push to make people segregate themselves into marginalized groups and programs where like-mindedness and groupthink prevail are the antithesis of what God's plan ultimately will do for us. It allows us to become something entirely new and greater. We are not gay, straight, black, white, conservative, liberal, or any other label you can think of for humankind. We are children of God and Christ. We are heirs to thrones. Kings and Queens. Priests and Priestesses. Gods and Goddesses. For me, when viewed in that light, silly terms that people try to thrust us into so we can shape our worldview according to their parameters seem pretty small and limiting.

As soon as we start thinking about ourselves as anything but the titles that God wants to give us, we are diminishing ourselves and our potential. These obstacles that we perceive between us and God, these names we give them, they truly are but a blip on the eternal scale. They matter so little. Let's not give them more attention than they deserve.",God is in the plan. Satan is on the margins. We choose which way to go.

That to me is taking the Lord's name in vain, and the sin of that falls on the heads of the parents or bishops somewhere down the line since clearly the children are innocent and were not taught right (this as probably been snowballing for generations). 

But it's sad that the children would grow up thinking they have the Gift of the Holy Ghost when in reality it's probably not activated yet since they've never stopped and really chosen the covenant in their heart. I think this is why a lot of people have trouble receiving personal revelation. They've been told their whole lives that because the ordinance was performed they have made the covenant and get the blessings of that covenant‚Äîbut that's just not how it works. It's about heart. 

I'm totally fine if my children deciding to wait to get baptized‚Äîand I'll want them to know that, like their Heavenly Parents, my love for them is not conditional on them choosing to get baptized or anything. Their value and my love will be constant, and their agency is their own. This way my children will be able to choose baptism for the right reasons whenever they are ready. And that will set them up for more success when they go to the temple someday. You're not supposed to go to the temple unless you've made the baptismal covenant. Otherwise you're foundation is built upon sand right? I blog about my baptism thoughts in more detail here:

[https://www.finallyfreemarie.com/post/new-eyes-communication-misunderstandings-5](https://www.finallyfreemarie.com/post/new-eyes-communication-misunderstandings-5)

Anyways, I just think we have some traditions that are not good for our mental or spiritual health, but we can easily break away from those things by living the gospel with more heart and intention. The gospel is not always the same thing as cultural traditions. 

Is anyone else on the same page with me as this? I've never heard anyone talk about it and I just think it's strange how common it is for children to get baptized immediately at 8. Shouldn't it be common for lots of children to not understand or not feel ready yet and decide to wait for a little while?",Are we taking the Lord's name in vain? Are we setting people up for failure to receive personal revelation and other covenantal blessings?
437,latterdaysaints,"That was the thing that always got to me. I could have people come up to me and ask why we believe what we believe, in regards to homosexuality, and explain it just fine. But when someone said *that* it always kind of stumped me. Of course I knew it was in correct. I have people who I love dearly who are gay. But you can't say that without being accused of pulling the ""I have *blank* friends. I can't be criticized"" card. But even beyond that, I knew that if I didn't have gay friends and relatives I could still believe it was wrong and not be a bigot. It was so hard to explain because it made sense in my mind (I felt at peace with knowing that I didn't subconsciously hate gay people) but I still could communicate how it just made sense to me that these things can both exist together. 

Anyways, I found [this article](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/how-i-wish-the-homosexuality-debate-would-go/)  on r/Christianity and it really helped me to find words for it. It's a (old, from 2011) hypothetical interview with a pastor (this is not an LDS publication) about why homosexuality is a sin in Christianity. 1) I like that this is an article from another branch of Christianity. It reminds me that were not alone in believing this. And 2) Its a smart, and takes a stand, but in a very loving and Christlike way. 

Of course, with that knowledge we have in our Gospel specially, there is more conversation to had (what with how important marriage is to us in the next life). But this is a good start to that conversation. 

This is my favorite bit (but I'd recommend reading the whole article).

&gt;Host:¬†But who are you to condemn someone who doesn‚Äôt line up with your personal beliefs about sexuality?

&gt;Pastor:¬†Who am I? No one. It‚Äôs not all that important what I think about these things. This conversation about homosexuality isn‚Äôt really about my personal beliefs. They‚Äôre about Jesus and what He says. I have no right to condemn or judge the world. That right belongs to Jesus. My hope is to¬†follow Him faithfully. That means that whatever¬†He¬†says in regard to sexual practices is what I believe to be true, loving, and ultimately best for human flourishing ‚Äì even when it seems out of step with the whims of contemporary culture.

&gt;Host:¬†But you¬†are¬†judging. You are telling all the gay people watching this broadcast that they are sinners.

&gt;Pastor:¬†I‚Äôm not singling out gay people. I‚Äôm pointing to Jesus as the answer to¬†all¬†sexual sinfulness.

&gt;Host:¬†But you¬†are¬†referring to gay people. Why are you so focused on homosexuality?

&gt;Pastor:¬†With all due respect, you are the one who brought up this subject.

&gt;Host:¬†Are you saying that you can‚Äôt be gay and Christian?

]Pastor:¬†No. I‚Äôm saying that you can‚Äôt be a genuine Christian without repentance. Everyone ‚Äì including me ‚Äì is guilty of sin, but Christianity hinges on repentance. We agree with God about our sin, and we turn from it and turn toward Jesus. When it comes to Christianity, this debate is not about homosexuality versus other sins. It‚Äôs about whether or not repentance is integral to the Christian life.

&gt;Host:¬†But do you see why a homosexual watching this might think you are¬†attacking them personally? You‚Äôre saying that something is wrong with them.

&gt;Pastor:¬†I think Jesus‚Äô teaching on sexuality shows us that there is something wrong with¬†all of us ‚Äì¬†something that can only be fixed by what Jesus did for us on the cross and in His resurrection. That said, I understand why people might think I am attacking them personally.¬†Most people with same-sex desires believe they were born with these tendencies. That‚Äôs why they often see their attraction as going to the very core of who they are, and so they identify themselves with the ‚Äúgay‚Äù label. So whenever someone questions their behavior or desires, they take it as an attack on the very core of their being. That‚Äôs usually not the intent of the person who disagrees with homosexual behavior. But that‚Äôs the way it is perceived. I understand that.

&gt;Host:¬†If it‚Äôs true that a person is born with one sexual orientation or another, then how can it possibly be loving to condemn one person‚Äôs orientation?

&gt;Pastor:¬†Well, we really don‚Äôt know for certain about sexual attraction being innate and set from birth. All we have is the testimony of people who say that they‚Äôve experienced same-sex desires since childhood. Christianity teaches that all people are born with a bent toward sin. It‚Äôs possible that some people will have a propensity toward alcohol abuse or angry outbursts, while others may have a propensity toward other sins. Regardless,¬†Christians believe people are more than their sexual urges. We believe that human dignity is diminished whenever we define ourselves by sexual urges and behaviors. Consider this: married men are sometimes attracted to multiple women who are not their wives. Does this mean they should self-identify as polygamists? Not at all. And surely you wouldn‚Äôt consider it hateful for Christians to encourage married men¬†not¬†to¬†act on their desires in an effort to remain faithful to their spouses. It is the Christian way, after all.

&gt;Host:¬†No, but it still seems like you are telling people not to be true to who they are.

&gt;Pastor:¬†It only seems that way because you believe sexual desire reflects the core of one‚Äôs identity. It would help if you and others who agree with you would understand that in your putting pressure on me to accept homosexual behavior as normal and virtuous,¬†you¬†are going to the very core of¬†my¬†identity as a follower of Jesus. The label most important to me is ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù My identity ‚Äì in Christ ‚Äì is central to who I am. So I could say the same thing and call you intolerant, bigoted, and hateful for trying to change a conviction that goes to the core of who I am as a Christian. I don‚Äôt say that because I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs your intention. But neither should you think it‚Äôs my intention to attack a homosexual person or cause them harm merely because I disagree.","""You can't say homosexuality is wrong without being hateful"""

440,latterdaysaints,"All I've been able to think about recently is about the PME- I have read a lot about it, pondered about it in the temple, and even dug out the Joseph Smith Manuel and read the chapter on the PME as well as the King Follot Sermon. 

As I've read more into it, the whole idea of an ""intelligence"" is fascinating to me- there's this whole idea that Joseph Smith talked about when he referred to the fact that our intelligence is something that is strictly eternal. Joseph made the analogy that, in order to be an eternal being, each and everyone of us (including God, Jesus Christ Etc) must have existed in some sort of state for literally ever. He likened it to a ring that you would wear on your finger--there is no start or stop, it is simply a continuous loop. 
 
 If that is the case, is the universe teeming with intelligences that have yet to be ""scooped up"", so to speak, and given a spirit body? Joseph Smith also talks about God and His glory, and states that God says that, as more and more of his children become exalted, he gains more and more Glory unto himself.
 
 I imagine that there are probably quintillions of intelligences waiting for more people to be, exalted, in order for there to be more gods, and allow more intelligences to receive a spirit body and participate in the Plan of Salvation.

""This is a hinge point in the history of the Church, and your part is vital.""

A hinge point is a point in a lesson when you need to check if students are ready to move on, and if yes, in which direction. I believe the Lord is watching us to give us the opportunity to follow the prophet in faith, and, if we do, take the church in a new, holier direction. The restoration isn't over. There is still so much more to come forth, but only as much as the church (collectively) is ready to receive. The Lord told Moroni in 3 Nephi 26, 

""9 And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them.
			10 And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the greater things be withheld from them, unto their condemnation.
			11 Behold, I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it, saying: I will try the faith of my people.""

The vulnerability displayed in your book is awesome! You seem like a person that I would like to be friends with. Thanks for sharing your story. I‚Äôm not writing this because the book ""Is He Nuts?"" Why a Gay Man Would Become a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ"" wasn‚Äôt enjoyable, or was poorly written.

My reasons for leaving a negative review would be: 

1. I feel an elephant in the room throughout the entire book. It‚Äôs that according to the LDS church, you must STOP living a gay life in order to receive God‚Äôs blessings, and have membership. Doing this and at the same time celebrating your individual homosexuality is problematic, even hypocritical. According to LDS doctrine, all you have to do is kiss one guy, and your blessings are revoked. That doesn‚Äôt feel like what Jesus would do to me. You seem to ignore that the loving treatment you receive is on account of them believing that you‚Äôve changed or have been fixed. When you change again in the future, you will undoubtedly be treated differently. Being that you‚Äôve stopped or changed being gay, your book title is misleading.

2. Throughout your learning and joining the church, you don't include consideration of how a younger version of yourself, or people different than you would react to, or be treated by, missionaries and church doctrines (you‚Äôre an affluent white male).

3. As a lifelong member myself, It‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre joining while not aware of: 

A. Dallin H. Oaks career in the church

F. LDS Sunday school lesson about Chewed Gumctice of reparative therapy for ‚Äúsame-sex attraction.‚Äù

I have been to my nieces blessings and they all wore cute white baby dresses. Does the outfit need to be white? Or was that just a coincidence. I've only ever seen baby girls being blessed so I just need some boy outfit ideas. üòÖ Thank you so much!",Non member needing help for baby blessing outfit!

488,latterdaysaints,"I did not grow up with any religious faith. My parents are great people. They are kind, generous, and forgiving. But they did not give me a religion to follow. They always told me that they don't believe in a god, but believe in human nature. I love and respect and admire my parents. I understand where they are coming from. They were great parents to me and my sister and brother. They taught me to believe in myself and to work hard. I have done well, and have a graduate degree and a good job. My parents have always loved and cherished me. They are really great people. 

My parents are proud of me. I love them so much. But I have always felt there was something out there that I needed to find. I am seeking a path right now, and I read the Book of Mormon and it feels real to me. I have also read the Bible in its entirety, and it feels real to me, too, though the Old Testament is a bit dicey in places and hard to understand what with all of the rules and lineages and such, but I do get that since it is an account of ancient days. I should say that the Book of Ether is also hard to understand for me, it did not seem in tune with the rest of the Book of Mormon.  I told my parents all of this, and they told me to follow my heart. They have not judged me for wanting something that exists beyond this world, though they do not believe in it. So I am looking and wondering. 

I love the stories in the Book of Mormon. I love that it happened in the Americas. It makes sense to me that Jesus would appear to people across the world, not just in the place where he died. If he is the savior for all of us, he must have appeared to people around the planet. That makes sense to me. I have watched so MANY YouTubes about Jesus' life from so many perspectives and it really sings to me. I believe in him. I can't explain why. It doesn't matter whether it is Baptist or Catholic or LDS or whatever, just seeing anything about Jesus (from a positive perspective) makes me happy. I think he was real and was really the son of God. 

I can feel that Jesus is real. I can feel that he loves us and that he has done something incredible for us. I believe that he would have visited multiple places to let all of us know. I think that's why I am writing this here, now. I have looked into so many religions, and this one is the only one that makes sense to me. 

I did invite missionaries to come and visit me via the LDS website, but when they did, they were so young. I am in my mid-30's now and they were much younger, and from reading about LDS I understand that is the way (cue the Mandalorian here...). I am also female, and these guys were adorable and kind and truly beautiful in all ways, but I could not relate to them. I am also highly educated and (this is embarrassing to admit as it makes me look like I feel superior to folks who do not have the education I do, and I do not mean that at all, just that they were so young and inexperienced), I felt that my questions and ponderings were so much above their heads. I do not fault them. From what I have read, missionaries are very young adults. I can't compare their understanding and experience to my own. I just want to learn. I can see why the missionaries would move people, but they did not move me. They actually made me feel worse about it all.

Are there missionaries who have been through college and can discuss things at a higher level? (This sounds so stupid.) I know that faith is what counts in religion. But I also want to have a real discourse with folks. 

I'm not even sure what I'm asking here. I guess I just want to have an intellectual conversation in person with someone(s) who just want to talk about the literature and what it means. I have already accepted that all of these words are from a higher being. I just want to talk about it without reducing it to rote memory. Is there anyone I should contact? Are their older missionaries with education I can talk to? That sounds so elitist, and I really really really times a million don't want to be ""that"" person, but that's where I am. I'm not questioning anything (believe me, I have read all of the negative stuff, and I mean ALL of the negative stuff). I just want to have a fun, real, intelligent discourse with someone in person, so that I can feel comfortable.",I am trying to understand Jesus' life and my life and the missionaries and what I should do next
489,latterdaysaints,"I turn to this amazing community with a question once again, you have helped me a lot before, and thank you. I hope I'm not too annoying. I'm going to ask my teachers, but I want to know others' opinions as well. Here goes: It was suggested to me to read the Pearl of Great Price, as I'm preparing for the endowment. I've read this last part of our scriptures only once, the first time I read the Triple Combination, and decided to never open the PofGP again. I believe in the Bible, the BoM, and DnC, but I'm not sure about the rest. As a child I was a fan of Ancient Egypt and studied it a lot, and when I see ~~Nasus~~  Anubis, Sobek, and 4 ""jars"" used for organs at mummification, why are the notes telling me it's something else? The scriptures themselves are more or less fine, I can read them and learn from them. I just don't like the source, the facsimile. Is there a statement from the Church regarding this? I tried looking it up but it didn't help much. I pray that the Lord helps me understand, but so far nothing. Am I still worthy to get endowed even if I don't 100% believe in the PofGP?",I think I hit a pearly wall

491,latterdaysaints,"So while I was reading 1 Nephi today I was also in the footnotes and googling things of interest. I came across something called the Deuteronomic Reform which occurred in the reign of Josiah (the king previous to Zedekiah). He was a literalist and forced Israel to obey the Law as given in Deuteronomy. This included the destruction of altars outside the temple, the destruction of teachings not found therein etc. 

I also found an interesting article that discusses the fact that Nephi and Lehi, from their actions like building an altar outside of Jerusalem, were mainly anti-reformists whereas Laman and Lemuel were all for those traditions. The article is here

497,latterdaysaints,"A little bit of background, I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for a little over a year. He grew up in catholic/Christian background, but has since become more of a factual-based person and struggles with the faith and belief side of things. However, he recently has been watching videos about people who have left religions and their stories, and incidentally stumbled across a Mormon one. Since then, he sent it to me and asked for my thoughts, and has since been asking many questions in many regards to the different aspects of the church, like the Book of Mormon and Joseph smith and baptism. This is great and I‚Äôm really excited to be sharing this aspect of my life with him, as I never really wanted to force it on to him. However, he‚Äôs asking so many questions that I feel really inadequate to answer. I am currently at BYU so I have a lot of knowledge just from the religion courses, but haven‚Äôt served a mission or just really ever had a solid knowledge of a lot about the church. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to mess it up somehow for him... what should I try doing?
